Science and Research Priority areas
A set of priority areas identified by the Australian Government that replaced the Strategic
Research Priority areas in 2015. The priorities are designed to focus Australian Government
support for science and research on the most important challenges facing Australia. The
current Science and Research Priority areas are: food, soil and water, transport, cybersecurity,
energy, resources, advanced manufacturing, environmental change and health. Each priority is
associated with 3 to 4 Practical Research Challenges, which aim to prioritise the development of
Australia’s research and innovation capabilities in areas the Australian Government regards as
pivotal to the nation’s future.
