Research funding statistics and data

The datasets on this page are updated annually to include each year’s new awards and to refresh the data for continuing grants

These data represent a snapshot of the NHMRC‘s research funding activity at the time that the data was extracted from our systems. These data were last updated 22 March 2022.
Changes to previously reported data

Our funding data have undergone cleaning to improve data quality. The method for collecting and collating application and grant data by disease, health and research topic was recently updated to ensure a more robust output for past, present and future reporting. As such, dollar amounts, application and grant totals for a number of topics have been adjusted to include not only new results, but also past applications and grants not identified using older forms of data collection.
NHMRC Funding for major diseases, conditions or health areas

The majority of NHMRC funding is investigator-initiated and is not directed by NHMRC to any specific disease, health or research topic. The subject matter of each application is determined by the applicants. Additionally, a proportion of NHMRC funds is directed to specific topics primarily through the Targeted Calls for Research and International Collaboration schemes, or priorities identified in the NHMRC Corporate Plan.

Funding decisions are the outcome of a competitive process that relies on the collective judgement of independent peer reviewers. There is strong demand for NHMRC funding and the process is very competitive, so not all high quality research proposals are able to be funded.

For reporting purposes, NHMRC classifies applications against disease, health and research topics based on information provided at the time of application including an application’s title, keywords, media summaries and other research classifications where appropriate.

This process results in the classification of applications to more than one topic. NHMRC does not apportion funding when more than one topic is indicated and the full value of the grant is attributed.

Relevance to the topic may be either a direct focus or a broader focus such as a longer term potential benefit. The resulting datasets may include a broad range of research from discovery science through to clinical research, health services and public health research.

COVID-19 impacts

The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is committed to supporting national and international efforts, including NHMRC funded experts, to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences.
