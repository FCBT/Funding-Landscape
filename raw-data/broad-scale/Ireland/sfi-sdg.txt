The overarching purpose of the SDG Challenge is to develop transformative, sustainable solutions that will contribute to addressing development challenges under the UN SDGs in Irish Aidâ€™s partner countries.

The SDG Challenge will be run within the challenge-funding framework of the SFI Future Innovator Prize Programme. As such, they share common objectives. Furthermore, the SDG Challenge have its own specific objectives, which are as follows: 

    To provide opportunities for Ireland-based researchers to form diverse teams to identify key development challenges where technology can deliver transformative impact with a focus on southern partner countries; 
    To enable the development of collaborations between researchers in Ireland and researchers in partner countries where Irish Aid works; 
    To support the development, deployment and demonstration of sustainable technologies responding to the identified challenges.
    To promote sustainability and the important role that STEM plays in addressing global sustainability issues and the SDGs.
