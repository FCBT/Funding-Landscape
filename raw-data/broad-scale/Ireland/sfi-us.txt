The overall goal of the Partnership is to increase the level of collaborative R&D amongst researchers and industry across the three jurisdictions. This collaboration aims to generate valuable discoveries and innovations which are transferable to the marketplace, or will lead to enhancements in health, disease prevention or healthcare.

The Partnership achieves its goals through tri-partite research projects in which the funding agencies fund the elements of research undertaken in their own jurisdiction. Importantly, the Partnership must add significant value to each research programme above that achievable by the PI in each jurisdiction working alone.

The current focus of the US-Ireland R&D Partnership Programme, as agreed by the Partnership Steering Group, is on the following seven thematic areas:

    Sensors & Sensor Networks
    Nanoscale Science & Engineering
    Telecommunications
    Energy & Sustainability
    Health
    Cybersecurity (new theme)
    Agriculture
