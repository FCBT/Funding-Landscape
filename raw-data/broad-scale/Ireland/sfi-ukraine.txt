Objectives

    To encourage and enable SFI grant holders of existing SFI grants, and their associated Host Institutions, to provide opportunities for displaced STEM researchers from Ukraine to join and collaborate on existing SFI-funded projects.
    To integrate displaced Ukrainian researchers into SFI-funded projects, so that they may gain valuable research experience, relevant to their field of STEM.
    The displaced Ukrainian researcher will add significant value to the research project, contributing to, for example research papers, conference proceedings and/or training of students.
