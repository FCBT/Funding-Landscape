The SFI ERC Support Programme is run as a rolling call. Applications are invited from senior representatives of the Host Institutions of recruited awardees that have been funded through the ERC Starting Grant, Consolidator Grant, Advanced Grant or Synergy Grant schemes. The ERC awardee associated with the application must have succeeded in obtaining their award from a Host Institution outside of Ireland. The proximity of an application to this programme to the official starting date of the associated ERC award may affect the level of funding available. The aims of the SFI ERC Support Programme are:

    To allow Irish institutions to recruit ERC-funded researchers from outside of Ireland 
    To help recruited ERC awardees by providing excellent facilities and infrastructure 
    To enhance the benefits of applying to ERC schemes for institutions and applicants  
    To increase, in the long term, the participation of Ireland-based researchers in all ERC schemes 
    To increase, in the long term, Irelandâ€™s success rate across all ERC schemes
