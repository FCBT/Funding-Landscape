Programme Objectives

The Spokes programme serves to enhance the objectives of the Research Centres programme around research excellence with economic and societal impacts, leading to enhanced outputs for the centre(s) including diversified funding, commercialisation, education & public engagement and training, in addition to increasing the number of targeted projects within an existing SFI Research Centre.

The specific objectives of the SFI Spokes programme are:  

    To support and incentivise SFI Research Centres to drive activity in a collaborative manner in areas of national strategic importance, both in the context of economic recovery and growth, as well as with a societal focus, to deliver tangible benefits for Ireland. 
    To provide a mechanism to support multi-stakeholder partnerships of scale with SFI Research Centres, encompassing a variety of funding sources, enabling new industry, academic and other partners such as government bodies, charity and philanthropy to join a Research Centre, and to increase geographical involvement and engagement. 
    To provide a mechanism to drive cross-centre initiatives between the SFI Research Centres as well as with other national partnerships/centres in support of a more cohesive research ecosystem.
    To allow current SFI Research Centres to expand, evolve and build capabilities in line with emerging opportunities.
    To support joint collaborative research projects with industry.*
    To improve SME engagement in SFI Research Centres and collaboration with academics and larger companies.  
    To address gender imbalance at all levels within the SFI Research Centres.
