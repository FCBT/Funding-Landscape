Be part of Canadaâ€™s Clean Energy Future
The Energy Innovation Program (EIP) advances clean energy technologies that will help Canada meet its climate change targets, while supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. It funds research, development and demonstration projects, and other related scientific activities.

Managed by the Office of Energy Research and Development (OERD), EIP has an annual grants and contributions budget and runs targeted calls, and other strategic collaboration and investments programs.
