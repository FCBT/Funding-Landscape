Funding to support space research
The Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) Flights and Fieldwork for the Advancement of Science and Technology (FAST) funding initiative supports space research in Canadian post-secondary institutions. FAST grants enable students (college, undergraduate and graduate) and young researchers (post-doctoral fellows) to gain hands-on experience in space-like missions, and support the development of space science and technologies.

Objectives
Develop and maintain the expertise of the next generation of space researchers and other professionals in space-related fields in Canada
Provide students with opportunities to participate in hands-on activities to gain knowledge and acquire the skills sought by employers in the space sector
Increase scientific knowledge
Develop new technologies
Funding
A maximum of $300,000 can be awarded per project, depending on the Announcement of Opportunity (AO) and funding categories. The funds usually cover a period of up to three years.

Eligibility
Canadian post-secondary institutions (colleges and universities).

Projects
Since 2010, FAST has invested over $29.5M to support 118 projects led by 29 Canadian universities involving over 950 students and young researchers.
