Funding
The Lake Winnipeg Basin Program (LWBP) has committed $8 million in application-based funding to continue its support for targeted, outcome-focused actions that address at least one of the three program priorities:

Nutrient reduction: support targeted stakeholder delivered projects in the Lake Winnipeg Basin, in key geographic areas, that demonstrate an effective means to reduce phosphorus loading and increase public knowledge and engagement
Collaborative governance: encourage and strengthen collaborative efforts to reduce nutrients throughout the Lake Winnipeg Basin
Indigenous engagement: enhance opportunities, capacity and the engagement of Indigenous governments, organizations and communities on Lake Winnipeg Basin nutrient issues
Funding details
funding is available between April 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022
the LWBP will not fund 100% of project expenses (please note matching requirements below)
LWBP funding can only be applied to activities completed by March 31, 2022
Matching requirements
The LWBP aims to provide one-third of the total project costs, however, in some cases up to two-thirds of total project costs may be funded through the LWBP. Emphasis will be placed on leveraging other funding sources and collaborative partnerships. In cases where other federal programs are providing financial support for the project, the total federal contribution must not exceed two thirds of the total cost of the project.

Potential sources of matching funds (cash and in-kind) and how collaborations are to be undertaken (e.g. contributions by the applicant, landowners or others involved in the project, use of equipment, expertise etc.) must be clearly outlined and described in the proposal budget.

Selection process
Each project proposal will go through a three stage review process:

administrative review by program staff to confirm eligibility
technical review by subject-matter experts to confirm scientific and technical feasibility
regional review to ensure that environmental and departmental priorities are considered in the project approval process, with approval in principle made by ECCC
Eligible project proposals will be assessed against, but not limited to, the following criteria:

Results
project addresses at least one of the three key freshwater priority issues for the LWBP
there is good value for dollars invested
Uptake and engagement
strong collaboration between project partners
enhanced Indigenous participation and collaboration
opportunities for technology and/or knowledge transfer to other parts of the Lake Winnipeg Basin and across watersheds

Successful recipients
Notification and reporting requirements
Once departmental approval in principle has been confirmed, applicants (both successful and unsuccessful) will be notified in writing.  If your project proposal submission is approved in principle, you will be contacted to negotiate a Contribution Agreement, which outlines the terms and conditions of funding. Federal MPs and/or their team may be advised about the approval in principle of a project and may be provided with information provided in this application including applicant’s name, project title, project description, project location, funding amounts and contact information.

Funding is conditional on the successful negotiation of a Contribution Agreement between the applicant and ECCC. It is important to note that project activities for which you wish to receive LWBP funding cannot begin until the Contribution Agreement is signed. We work towards completing this process within 40 working days.  Please note that this 40 working day standard for the development of a contribution agreement is a shared responsibility and largely depends on the submission of all required documentation to ECCC in a diligent and timely fashion.

Each Contribution Agreement must include written confirmation of all funding sources, a summary of project design, delivery, progress evaluations and anticipated results, as well a budget forecast. All of these components must be accurately completed before the agreement can be signed.

All approved recipients are required to submit reports to ECCC throughout the duration of the project as outlined in the Contribution Agreement. Payments are based on reporting, meaning that payments cannot be made until a report has been submitted, reviewed and deemed satisfactory. Reports are submitted to and reviewed by an ECCC project officer.

Once a recipient’s project has finished a final report is required. The final report should include a project evaluation, financial and in-kind contribution records and, if applicable, a financial audit. The final payment will not be provided (minimum 10% holdback) until a final report has been submitted, reviewed and approved by ECCC.
