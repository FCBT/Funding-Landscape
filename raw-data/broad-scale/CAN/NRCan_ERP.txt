Action on Emerging Renewable Power
The Emerging Renewable Power Program (ERPP) provides up to $200 million to expand the portfolio of commercially viable renewable energy sources available to provinces and territories as they work to reduce GHG emissions from their electricity sectors.

What is the Emerging Renewable Power Program?
Emerging renewable projects face higher risks, costs and more regulatory issues than projects using established renewable energy sources.

This program mitigates the risk of emerging renewable power projects through federal government funding, allowing emerging renewables to play a larger role in Canada’s electricity supply mix.

The program will establish new industries in Canada by supporting renewable power technologies that are:

already established at the commercial level abroad but not yet in Canada
demonstrated in Canada but not yet deployed at utility scale
