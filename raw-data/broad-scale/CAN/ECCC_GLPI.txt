Great Lakes Protection Initiative
Through the Great Lakes Protection Initiative, the Government of Canada takes action to address the most significant environmental challenges affecting Great Lakes water quality and ecosystem health by delivering on Canada’s commitments under the Canada-United States Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. It focuses on 8 priority areas for action:

working with others to protect the Great Lakes
restoring Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs)
preventing toxic and nuisance algae
assessing and enhancing the resilience of Great Lakes coastal wetlands
evaluating and identifying at risk nearshore waters
reducing releases of harmful chemicals
engaging Indigenous Peoples in addressing Great Lakes issues
increasing public engagement through citizen science
Funding
To assist in achieving this goal, we fund actions by others to:

restore AOCs by supporting action at the local level to restore water quality and aquatic ecosystem health through projects identified in AOC remedial action plans
prevent toxic and nuisance algae by increasing participation in the application of phosphorus load reduction measures and by demonstrating innovative approaches and best practices and promoting broad uptake and application
reduce releases of harmful chemicals by increasing participation in the application of beyond-compliance measures to reduce releases of chemicals of mutual concern by developing, implementing, assessing and promoting use of innovative approaches
engage Indigenous Peoples in addressing Great Lakes issues by enhancing Indigenous capacity to address Great Lakes issues through projects that engage Indigenous Peoples at the community level
increase public engagement through citizen science by enhancing Canadians’ knowledge of and engagement in addressing Great Lakes issues through participation in citizen science

Eligible project types
 	 	 	 
Implementing and evaluating innovative approaches or technologies to reduce phosphorus loads
Implementing and evaluating the effectiveness of Best Management Practices to reduce phosphorus loads
Increasing the extent of natural features (for example, wetlands) and/or enhancing their effectiveness in reducing phosphorus loads

All projects must contain an outreach plan detailing how the project will promote broad uptake and application of the phosphorus reduction measures demonstrated
Demonstration and assessment of approaches that reduce releases of CMCs in the Great Lakes basin from Canadian sources, such as:

Enhanced life-cycle / end of life management
 
Great Lakes restoration, conservation or protection projects
Science related to Great Lakes issues
Creation of networks for Indigenous experts to share knowledge/experience
Projects building awareness of Great Lakes issues
 
Projects that:

Increase the number of people participating in Great Lakes citizen science
Engage citizens in a manner that increases their knowledge of Great Lakes issues
Collect and make available useful scientific in-formation

 
Projects that contribute to directly eliminating identified “beneficial use impairments” through Action, Engagement and/or Science:

Action

Implement remedial actions that result in environmental improvement in AOCs, including habitat rehabilitation, rural non-point source control, contaminated sediment remediation, municipal wastewater treatment, urban storm water/combined sewer overflow control

Engagement

Support strategic engagement with local communities for Remedial Action Plan work planning, implementation and decision-making towards restoring beneficial use impairments

Science

Conduct science and monitoring to assess the status of beneficial use impairments against delisting targets and inform remedial action planning and implementation
