Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships program
The Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships program is administered by Canada’s three research granting agencies: the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).

The Banting Postdoctoral Fellowships program aims to attract and retain top-tier postdoctoral talent, both nationally and internationally, to develop their leadership potential and to position them for success as research leaders of tomorrow, positively contributing to Canada’s economic, social and research-based growth through a research-intensive career.

A Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship is valued at $70,000 per year (taxable), for two years.
