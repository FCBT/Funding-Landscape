Use of Northern Scientific Training Program funds
The programâ€™s funds are restricted. They are a supplement meant to offset the additional costs of northern research (e.g. transportation and living costs). The Northern Scientific Training Program is not intended to be a source of primary support for students pursuing northern research.

the extent to which the application fits within program guidelines

the training component of the application, and
the contribution to the development of northern specialists at the university.
This committee is also responsible for ensuring the effective use of funds allocated in the previous year.
