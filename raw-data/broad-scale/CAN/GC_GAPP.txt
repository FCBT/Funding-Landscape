Genomic Applications Partnership Program
To be eligible for GAPP funding, projects must:
develop and apply a genomics-derived tool, product or process to an opportunity or need defined by the Receptor(s);
focus on late stage R&D that will position the innovation for near term implementation / commercialization;
be co-led by an Academic and a Receptor organization in partnership, with active and necessary roles for both (see GAPP Investment Strategy and Guidelines for GAPP project partner definitions); and,
have the potential to generate significant social and/or economic benefits for Canada (see Section 6 for description of benefits to Canada).
Applicants can request up to 1/3 of the project budget from Genome Canada, from a minimum contribution of $100,000 to a maximum of $2 million. The remaining project funding must be secured from other eligible sources, with at least 1/3 provided by the Receptor(s). The duration of GAPP projects should be a minimum of one year to a maximum of three years, but may be shorter or longer if justified.

All applications to GAPP must be submitted via a regional Genome Centre. Please contact your regional Genome Centre for more information.
