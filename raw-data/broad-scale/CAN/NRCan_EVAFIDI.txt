What is EVAFIDI?
The Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment Initiative (EVAFIDI) was launched by Natural Resources Canada in 2016 to provide funding to organizations to help establish:

a coast to coast network of EV fast-chargers along core routes and highways
natural gas refuelling sites along key freight corridors
hydrogen refuelling sites in major cities
This public infrastructure will help Canadians feel confident making the switch to low- or zero-emission vehicles. EVAFIDI has now ended. The Program is no longer launching Request for Proposals.

Canada needs to scale up its zero-emission vehicle infrastructure
Canada has committed to building 50,000 new EV charging and hydrogen refuelling sites.
