Program Background

The Office of Energy Research and Development (OERD) at Natural Resources Canada is responsible for the management and development of energy research and development across the federal government.  Since 1974, under programs such as the Program of Energy Research and Development (PERD) and more recently a segment of the Energy Innovation Program (EIP), OERD has ensured that federal energy research and development priorities are aligned across departments and agencies.

The various programs that constitute the Federal Internal Energy R&D suite promote and support energy RD&D by funding related RD&D activities in federal departments and agencies.  OERD builds on the synergies among participants to ensure resources are deployed effectively, coordinate research activities, and improve decision-making in federal energy RD&D investments 

PROGRAM FUNDING STRUCTURE
To reinforce synergies and to ensure alignment with government priorities, OERD has developed four Missions to guide each research activity across the federal government. Each Mission has been developed to focus research, ensure synergies across each Mission and reduce duplication in research and development.
