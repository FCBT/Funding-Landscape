Overview
We provide financial support to non-profit and non-government organizations for Canadian communities to take on local action-based projects that produce measurable, positive effects on the environment and to build the capacity of communities to sustain these activities in the future.

Objectives
EcoAction funds projects that:

Your project must address the following priority result:

Canadians contribute to improving freshwater quality through actions that reduce harmful substances in freshwater and/or restore and protect freshwater ecosystem health.

lead to results and engagement that will be sustained after the completion of EcoAction funding
As indicated in the program's list of performance indicators (available via the Grants and Contributions Enterprise Management System (GCEMS) portal), all projects must also include:

at least one environmental indicator; and,
at least one capacity building indicator.
Additionally, a minimum of at least 50% of the total value of your project must come from sources other than the Government of Canada.

Eligible project costs
The following project costs are eligible under EcoAction:

human resources, including salaries and benefits
contractors
management and professional services (e.g., accounting, audit, liability insurance costs that are directly attributed to carrying out the project, monitoring, legal or other professional fees translation)
travel and field expenses (based on Government of Canada rates)
materials and supplies
communication, production, distribution and printing costs
equipment purchases or rental fees
vehicle rental and operation costs
a reasonable share of overhead and/or administrative costs and rent that is directly attributed to program delivery
Available funding
The maximum EcoAction funding is $100,000 per project; the minimum funding amount request is $25,000 per project. The maximum project duration is 36 months.

A minimum of 50% of the total project value must come from sources other than the Government of Canada. Consequently, EcoAction can fund a maximum of half a projectâ€™s expenses provided that no other Government of Canada funds are used. An exception to this requirement are funds from programs for Indigenous Peoples within Indigenous Services Canada. These funds may be included as matching funding for the project.

Please note: Funding from employment support programs within Employment and Social Development Canada are also exempt from this requirement; however, they cannot be used as matching funding for the project.

Please contact your Regional Office for more information.
