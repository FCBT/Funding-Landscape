Develop innovative satellite data solutions to help meet various needs on Earth and in our everyday lives
Increase collaboration among Canadian stakeholders
Enhance expertise, growth and competitiveness in Canada's space sector
Advance scientific knowledge
Funding
Available funding varies depending on the Request for Proposal (RFP) or Announcement of Opportunity (AO). The funds usually cover a period ranging from one to three years.
