Polar Knowledge Canada’s (POLAR’s) Science and Technology Program
Polar Knowledge Canada (POLAR) supports research projects within its Science and Technology Program, which aims to create a strong research presence in Canada’s Arctic through POLAR. The program builds a knowledge base to support effective solutions to Arctic issues, northern policy and research development, and advances Canada’s position as a leading Arctic nation.

The first call for proposals focused on strengthening monitoring in northern Canada and research in northern regions of significant resource development. Proposals were accepted for single or multi-year projects. Multi-year projects may extend through 2017-2018, subject to an annual proposal evaluation.

Future POLAR calls will be posted on this page.

Co-funding is encouraged between POLAR and the Northern Contaminants Programs as well as other related Arctic science programs such as ArcticNet, the Nunavut General Monitoring Plan, and the Cumulative Impacts Monitoring Program where applicable.
