Supports research on geochemical processes in Earth’s surface environmental systems on land, as well as the terrestrial interaction of geochemical and biological processes at all temporal and spatial scales.

Synopsis
The Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry Program supports research on geochemical processes in terrestrial Earth’s surface systems, as well as the interaction of geochemical and biological processes. Proposals may address field, laboratory, theoretical, or modeling studies of these processes and related mechanisms at all spatial and temporal scales. The Geobiology and Low-Temperature Geochemistry Program is interested in supporting transformational and cutting-edge research. The Program also supports the development of geochemical proxies and analytical techniques. The Program is highly interdisciplinary and interfaces with other programs within the Geosciences Directorate, and with programs across NSF, including in biology, chemistry, and engineering.
