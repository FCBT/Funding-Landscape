Supports research on the physical, chemical and biological processes that influence the Earthâ€™s climate over the long term and enables understanding of present climate variability and future trends.

Synopsis
Supports research on the natural evolution of Earth's climate with the goal of providing a baseline for present variability and future trends through improved understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence climate over the long-term.

Competitive proposals will address specific aspects of scientific uncertainty for their proposed research.

All four Divisions in the Geosciences Directorate have joined in creating the annual Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change (P2C2) competition in paleoclimate global change research.  Researchers are encouraged to consider the P2C2 competition as a possible source of support for their global change research. 

Since proposals eligible for funding in the P2C2 competition are not eligible for funding in the Paleoclimate Program, researchers are strongly advised to contact the Director of the Paleoclimate Program for guidance as to the suitability of their proposed research for either program.
