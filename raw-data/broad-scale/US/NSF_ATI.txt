Synopsis
The Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation (ATI) program provides individual investigator and collaborative research grants for development of new technologies and instrumentation for astronomy and astrophysics.  The program supports overarching science objectives of the Division of Astronomical Sciences.  Development of innovative, potentially transformative technologies are encouraged, even at high technical risk. Supported categories include but are not limited to:  advanced technology development or concept feasibility studies and specialized instrumentation to enable new observations that are difficult or impossible to obtain with existing means.  Proposals may include hardware and/or software development and/or analysis to enable new types of astronomical observations.  The program encourages making products of research available to the public.  It also encourages community coordination of technology and instrumentation development efforts via an annual Principal Investigators meeting.
