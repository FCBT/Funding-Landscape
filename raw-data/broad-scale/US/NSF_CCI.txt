Phase I (center development) and Phase II (major research centers)

Synopsis
The Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) Program supports research centers focused on major, long-term fundamental chemical research challenges. CCIs that address these challenges will produce transformative research, lead to innovation, and attract broad scientific and public interest. CCIs are agile structures that can respond rapidly to emerging opportunities through enhanced collaborations. CCIs integrate research with strong broader impacts, including innovation, education, broadening participation, and informal science communication.

The CCI Program is a two-phase program. Both phases are described in this solicitation. Phase I CCIs receive significant resources to develop the science, management and broader impacts of a major research center before requesting Phase II funding. Satisfactory progress in Phase I is required for Phase II applications; Phase I proposals funded in FY 2023 will seek Phase II funding in FY 2026.

The FY 2023 Phase I CCI competition is open to projects in all fields supported by the Division of Chemistry, and must have scientific focus and the potential for transformative impact in chemistry. The NSF Division of Chemistry particularly encourages fundamental chemistry projects aligned with articulated budget priorities, including Advanced Manufacturing, Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Climate Research and Sustainability, Clean Energy and Quantum Information Science. More information is available in Section IX of this Program Solicitation. 

The FY 2023 Phase II CCI competition is open to projects funded as Phase I awards in FY 2020.
