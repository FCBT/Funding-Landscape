Synopsis
The purpose of the NSF-Simons Research Centers for Mathematics of Complex Biological Systems (MathBioSys) is to enable innovative collaborative research at the intersection of mathematics and molecular, cellular and organismal biology, to establish new connections between these two disciplines, and to promote interdisciplinary education and workforce training. The National Science Foundation Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Simons Foundation Division of Mathematics and the Physical Sciences (MPS) and Division of Life Sciences shall jointly sponsor up to three new research centers to facilitate collaborations among groups of mathematicians, statisticians, and biologists. Research activities conducted at each center will be focused on a particular set of topics at the interface of the mathematical sciences with molecular, cellular, and organismal biology. Each center will conduct interdisciplinary education and training through research involvement of recent doctoral degree recipients and graduate students from across this multi-disciplinary spectrum. Each center is also expected to conduct convening activities, including short-term and/or long-term visitors programs, workshops, and/or outreach activities. These centers will have annual meetings of the Principal Investigators (PIs) and other principal researchers, held at the Simons Foundation in New York City.
