Synopsis
The Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program aims to support advanced wireless research platforms conceived by the U.S. academic and industrial wireless research community. PAWR will enable experimental exploration of robust new wireless devices, communication techniques, networks, systems, and services that will revolutionize the nation’s wireless ecosystem, thereby enhancing broadband connectivity, leveraging the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), and sustaining US leadership and economic competitiveness for decades to come.

In order to support the design, development, deployment, and operations of the advanced wireless research platforms, the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) will support the work of a PAWR Project Office (PPO). Working closely with the wireless research community, the PPO will assume responsibility for design, development, and deployment of a set of advanced wireless research platforms. Upon successful completion of the design of advanced wireless research platforms, and contingent upon support from NSF management, the PPO will proceed to the development and deployment phases with funding provided by NSF as well as a PAWR Industry Consortium. Upon successful deployment of each individual research platform, the PPO may subsequently operate the platform in service to the wireless research community.
