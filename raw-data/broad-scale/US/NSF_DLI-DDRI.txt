Supports doctoral research that digitally records and documents languages — with an emphasis on endangered languages — through the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples and databases, advancing linguistic theory and the study of language.

Synopsis
This program supports doctoral research focusing on building dynamic language infrastructure (DLI). Developing language infrastructure includes the documentation and preservations of languages in ways that articulate or advance linguistic theory, as well as the use of digitization techniques and novel computational methods that support and advance the study of language. Special emphasis is given to human languages that are endangered, i.e., understudied and at risk of falling out of use. The program supports the development of the next generation of researchers that contribute to language data management and archiving, and to the analysis of these archives to advance language infrastructure. Funding can support fieldwork and other activities relevant to the digital recording, documenting, and archiving of endangered languages, including the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples, and databases. Funding in this solicitation is in the form of doctoral dissertation research improvement grants (DDRIs) for up to 24 months and this solicitation addresses the preparation and evaluation of proposals for DDRI proposals.
