Synopsis
The Operations and Design cluster supports fundamental research in design, operation, optimization and control to advance the complex engineered and socio-technical systems critical to society. 

Programs in the Operations and Design cluster invest in theoretical, analytical, computational, and empirical research to enable systems that:

•  are efficient, reliable and resilient over the entire spectrum of operating conditions, including extreme perturbations such as those due to hazards and disasters;

•  address humans as an integral element of engineered systems or the engineering process;

•  support improved resource allocation and decision making, particularly in modern engineering and resilient communities contexts; and/or

•  improve the wellbeing of the population by reducing societal and economic risk, improving public health and safety, and increasing the nation’s industrial competitiveness.

Programs in the Operations and Design cluster value fundamental scientific and engineering contributions made with a holistic view of problems of societal importance.  Investigators may propose projects that make intellectual contributions within one or more of the following areas to further this aim.  Synergistic multidisciplinary collaborations are also welcome.  Proposals of all sizes will therefore be considered, as justified by the project description.  Investigators are encouraged to discuss their ideas with program directors well in advance of submission, especially for projects crossing domain boundaries.
