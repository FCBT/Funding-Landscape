Supports research and supplemental funding requests from current NSF awardees to facilitate professional development of K-12 science teachers.

Synopsis
The purpose of Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) activities is to facilitate professional development of K-12 science teachers through research experience at the cutting edge of science. The Directorate is particularly interested in encouraging its researchers to build mutually rewarding partnerships with teachers at inner city schools and less well endowed school districts. RET is described in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Solicitation (most recent solicitation found at http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&org=BIO&sel_org=BIO&from=fund)   See the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 18-089 for opportunity announcement.

Supplements can be made under an existing NSF award or within a proposal for a new or renewal NSF award. The Principal Investigator should consult with the Program Director of his/her particular NSF award.
