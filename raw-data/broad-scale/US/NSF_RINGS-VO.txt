Synopsis
The National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) solicit the submission of proposals to set up a Virtual Organization (VO) for the Resilient & Intelligent NextG Systems (RINGS) program. The RINGS program (NSF 21-581) is a partnership with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD R&E), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and a number of industry partners to enhance both resiliency as well as performance across the various aspects of Next Generation (NextG) communications, networking and computing systems. The goal of this solicitation is to invite the submission of proposals to set up a Virtual Organization (VO) for the RINGS program. The VO will facilitate coordination, collaboration, and community-building across academia, government, and industrial partners. The VO will serve the broader RINGS community, including Principal Investigators (PIs), researchers, and students, to coordinate their efforts and streamline their interactions with the RINGS partners in order to reduce burden on and improve synergies within the PI community. The VO will work closely with the RINGS partners to build a strong and effective research community to bolster U.S. leadership across wireless, cloud, and networking sectors.
