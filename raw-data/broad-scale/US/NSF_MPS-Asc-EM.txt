Synopsis
The MPS-Ascend External Mentoring (MPS-Ascend EM)â€¯program aims to fund an institution (or collaboration of institutions) to provide a mentored career development program specifically designed for two cohorts of MPS-Ascend Fellows funded through the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Ascending Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MPS-Ascend NSF 21-573, and NSF 22-501) programs. These activities should be designed to build cohort experiences for MPS-Ascend Fellows funded through the MPS competitions, provide professional development opportunities, and provide appropriate mentoring and professional networks to allow the Fellows to transition into, advance, and succeed in independent academic (or other) research careers. Each proposal should address the complete spectrum of MPS-Ascend Fellows, across all MPS fields. Approximately 30-50 MPS-Ascend Fellows are expected per cohort.

The aforementioned MPS-Ascend program supports future research leaders in all MPS fields (Astronomical Sciences, Chemistry, Physics, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences) by funding their participation in postdoctoral research environments that will have maximal impact on their future scientific development. This program has a strong emphasis on increasing the participation of members of those groups most underrepresented as leaders in MPS fields, which includes Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, and Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Native Pacific Islanders.
