Convergent Research and Innovation through Inclusive Partnerships and Workforce Development

Supports high-risk, high-payoff research centers focused on advancing engineered systems technology and education through multidisciplinary, cross-sector partnerships.

Synopsis
The ERC program supports convergent research (CR) that will lead to strong societal impact. Each ERC has interacting foundational components that go beyond the research project, including engineering workforce development (EWD) at all participant stages, diversity and a culture of inclusion (DCI) where all participants gain mutual benefit, and value creation within an innovation ecosystem (IE) that will outlast the lifetime of the ERC. The logical reasoning that links the proposed activities to the identified goals for each ERC should be clear.
