HDR TRIPODS Phase II

Synopsis
In 2016, the National Science Foundation (NSF) unveiled a set of "Big Ideas," ten bold, long-term research and process ideas that identify areas for future investment at the frontiers of science and engineering. The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research.

NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) Big Idea is a national-scale activity to enable new modes of data-driven discovery that will allow fundamental questions to be asked and answered at the frontiers of science and engineering.

Harnessing the Data Revolution: Transdisciplinary Research In Principles Of Data Science Phase II (HDR TRIPODS Phase II) aims to bring together the electrical engineering, mathematics, statistics, and theoretical computer science communities to develop the theoretical foundations of data science through integrated research and training activities. Phase I, described in solicitation NSF 19-550, supported the development of small collaborative Institutes. Phase II, described in this solicitation, will support a smaller number of larger Institutes, selected from the Phase I Institutes via a second competitive proposal process. All HDR TRIPODS Institutes must involve significant and integral participation by researchers representing the four aforementioned communities. Please note that the ordering of the four communities is alphabetical and is not meant to emphasize any one discipline over another.

When responding to this solicitation, even though proposals must be submitted through the Directorate for Engineering, Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems, once received, the proposals will be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors.
