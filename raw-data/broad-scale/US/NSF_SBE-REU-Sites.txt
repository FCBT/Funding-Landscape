Supports research participation by undergraduate students in any of the areas funded by the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.

Synopsis
The SBE REU Sites program is part of an NSF-wide program under a single solicitation administered individually by each Directorate. The SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (SMA) receives REU Site proposals for the entire SBE Directorate and runs the competition. An REU Site should provide research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme and may be based in a single discipline or academic department, or be interdisciplinary and multi-departmental.

The NSF-wide Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) solicitation governs the overall competition. The following clarifications/explanations are specifically for REU Site proposals submitted to SBE.

Maximum length of project duration is three years.
Typical funding is approximately $350,000, but if the proposal includes international activities, the budget can be higher.
Interdisciplinary REU Site proposals are welcome, but one or more of the elements of the research themes/topics must fall within the general scope of SBE Sciences or a combination of them.
Interested PIs are advised to explore the Active Directory of SBE REU Sites to determine the scope and breadth of fields funded under our program.

NOTE: All SBE REU Site applicants should submit their proposals to the NSF-wide REU solicitation and choose "SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (SMA)" as the appropriate Unit of Consideration. Proposals should adhere to both the guidelines listed in the NSF-wide REU solicitation as well as the SBE-specific ones listed above.
