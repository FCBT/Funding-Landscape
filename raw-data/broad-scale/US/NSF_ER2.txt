Supports research on what constitutes and promotes responsible research conduct and how to instill that knowledge in researchers, practitioners and educators across all career stages.

Synopsis
Ethical and Responsible Research (ER2) research projects use fundamental research to produce knowledge about what constitutes or promotes responsible or irresponsible conduct of research and why, as well as how to best instill responsible conduct of research into researchers, practitioners, and educators at all career stages. In some cases, projects will include the development of interventions or applications to ensure ethical and responsible research conduct.

The program funds research projects that identify:

(1)   factors that are effective in the formation of ethical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) researchers;

(2)   approaches to developing those factors in all STEM fields that NSF supports; and

(3)   why and how those factors and approaches increase responsibly conducted research.

Proposals from or involving substantial collaboration with minority-serving institutions, women's colleges, or organizations primarily serving persons with disabilities are strongly encouraged. Proposals that include international collaborations are encouraged if the unique resources, expertise, facilities, or locations of international partners enhance the merit of the proposed work. International partners are required to find non-NSF funding. Please see NSFâ€™s PAPPG for further guidance on international collaborations.
