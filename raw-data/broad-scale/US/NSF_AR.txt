Supports collaborative polar and cyberinfrastructure research on the interactions between the Antarctic region and global systems, and on Antarctic systems, biota and processes. Workshops, conferences and research coordination networks are also supported.

Synopsis
The Antarctic Sciences Section (ANT) of the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) supports cutting-edge research that:

Improves understanding of interactions among the Antarctic region and global systems;
Expands fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes; and
Utilizes the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform.
The U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) supports scientific research in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean with logistics provided by OPPâ€™s Antarctic Infrastructure and Logistics Section (AIL). Antarctic fieldwork is supported only for research that must be performed, or is best performed, in Antarctica. ANT encourages research, using existing samples, data, and models, that do not require fieldwork.

ANT encourages and supports research that crosses and combines disciplinary perspectives and approaches. ANT also supports proposals that promote effective collaborations between Polar and cyberinfrastructure researchers.

When making investments, ANT seeks broad representation of PIs and institutions in its award portfolio, including a geographically diverse set of institutions (including those in EPSCoR jurisdictions) and PIs who are women, early-career researchers, members of underrepresented minorities, veterans, and persons with disabilities.
