Synopsis
NSF celebrates the progress that U.S. universities have made in bringing diversity to the science and engineering enterprise. Strategies to successfully broaden participation during pre-college years will help ensure a diverse pool of future students, faculty and researchers. As a part of a new or renewal NSF proposal or as a supplemental funding request to an existing NSF Award, the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) will consider requests that:

Foster interest in the pursuit of studies in the Biological Sciences; and
Broaden participation of high school students, particularly those who are underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and women in sub-disciplines where they are underrepresented.
