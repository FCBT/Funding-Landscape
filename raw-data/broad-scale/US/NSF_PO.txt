Supports research on the structure and movement of oceans, how quantities are transported, how the ocean's structure interacts with biological and chemical processes within it, and the interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, climate and ice.

Synopsis
The Physical Oceanography Program supports research on a wide range of topics associated with the structure and movement of the ocean, with the way in which it transports various quantities, with the way the ocean's physical structure interacts with the biological and chemical processes within it, and with interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere, solid earth and ice that surround it.
