The LIFE programme 2021-2027Search for available translations of the preceding linkEN••• is divided into four sub-programmes: “Nature and biodiversity”, “Circular economy and quality of life”, “Climate change mitigation and adaptation” and “Clean energy transition”.

LIFE contributes to the transformation of the Union into a climate-neutral and resilient society, by supporting the implementation of the EU's climate policy as part of the Green Deal for Europe and preparing the EU for the climate challenges in the coming years and decades.
Supporting a climate neutral and resilient society

The LIFE Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation sub-programme manages about € 905 million to develop and implement innovative ways to respond to climate challenges. Its specific objectives are:

    to develop, demonstrate and promote innovative techniques, methods and approaches for reaching the objectives of Union legislation and policy on climate action and to contribute to the knowledge base and to the application of best practices;
    to support the development, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of relevant Union legislation and policy on climate action, including by improving governance at all levels, in particular through enhancing capacities of public and private actors and the involvement of civil society;
    to catalyse the large-scale deployment of successful technical and policy-related solutions for implementing relevant Union legislation and policy on climate action by replicating results, integrating related objectives into other policies and into public and private sector practices, mobilising investment and improving access to finance.
    The sub-programme Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation may cover activities related to energy efficiency and renewable energy, insofar that they are not covered by the Clean Energy Transition sub-programme.

Three priority areas

LIFE Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation supports public authorities, non-governmental organisations and private actors, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in contributing to the shift towards a sustainable, energy-efficient, renewable energy-based, climate-neutral and resilient economy, thereby contributing to sustainable development. The programme focuses on:
Climate change mitigation   Reducing greenhouse gas emissions
Climate change adaptation   Increasing resilience to climate change
Climate change governance and information   Increasing awareness, cooperation and dissemination on climate change mitigation
