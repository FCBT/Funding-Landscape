Subject areas

 

EMBO Programmes and activities are about research on the mechanisms of life at all levels, from single molecules to organisms and ecosystems. To be able to group and retrieve information from a particular area, we apply a system of 20 broad and non-exclusive categories to our projects, communities, and events. Brief descriptions and lists of keyword terms define the scope of these subject areas.
