Policy and strategy

The Joint Research Centre (JRC) is the European Commission's science and knowledge service which employs scientists to carry out research in order to provide independent scientific advice and support to EU policy.

The aim of this area of Horizon Europe is to generate high-quality scientific evidence for good public policies.

New initiatives and proposals for EU legislation need transparent, comprehensive and balanced evidence, whereas implementation of policies needs evidence to measure and monitor progress.

The JRC will provide EU policies with independent scientific evidence and technical support throughout the policy cycle. The JRC focuses its research on EU policy priorities.

The work programme for this area will support a number of the orientations defined in the Horizon Europe strategic plan.
