Policy and strategy

The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions are the EU flagship programme for doctoral and postdoctoral training, equipping researchers with new knowledge and skills through mobility across borders and exposure to different sectors and disciplines.

They enhance researchers’ training and career development systems and institutional and national recruitment processes in line with the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the recruitment of researchers.

The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fund the development of excellent doctoral and postdoctoral training programmes and collaborative research projects. They achieve a structuring impact on higher education institutions, research centres and other organisations way beyond academia by widely spreading excellence and setting standards for high-quality researcher education and training.

By doing so, they enhance the visibility and attractiveness of these organisations, not only across the European Research Area (ERA), but also worldwide.

Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions will also contribute to the orientations identified in the Horizon Europe strategic plan.
