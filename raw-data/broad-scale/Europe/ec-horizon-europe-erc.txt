Policy and strategy

The European Research Council, set up by the EU in 2007, is the premiere European funding organisation for excellent frontier research. 

It provides attractive and flexible funding to enable talented and creative individual researchers, with an emphasis on early stage researchers, and their teams to pursue the most promising avenues at the frontier of science, on the basis of EU-wide competition based solely on the criterion of excellence.

ERC grantees have already made advances  in new and emerging technological fields, including clean and digital technologies, as well as in many other areas targeted by the key strategic orientations of the Horizon Europe strategic plan.
