What We Do
The mission of WPTO is to enable research, development, and testing of new technologies to advance marine energy as well as next-generation hydropower and pumped storage systems for a flexible, reliable grid. To reduce marine energy costs and fully leverage hydropower’s contribution to the grid, WPTO invests in research and technology design; validates performance and reliability for new technologies; develops and enables access to necessary testing infrastructure; and disseminates objective information and data for technology developers and decision makers.

WPTO’s work directly supports EERE’s strategic objectives of increasing the Nation’s energy affordability, integration, and storage capabilities. This, in turn, supports DOE’s mission to ensure America’s security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. WPTO consists of two R&D programs: the Marine Energy Program and the Hydropower Program.

Why It Matters
WPTO works with National Laboratories, industry, universities, and other federal agencies to conduct R&D activities through competitively selected, directly funded, and cost-shared projects. In pursuing these objectives, WPTO always endeavors to:

Catalyze innovation in technology and science
Steward natural resources and support the public good
Expand access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy
Invest taxpayer funds wisely and to drive the greatest impact
Collaborate and actively seek input from stakeholders and partners
Demonstrate transparency and share results widely.
