Synopsis
OCE Education supports efforts to integrate ocean research and education via two main program areas, which are:

1) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program. This program provides funding to Universities and Marine Laboratories that allows them to offer summer internships to undergraduate students who would like to participate in ocean-related research efforts. Proposals may be submitted annually (August deadline).

2) Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER). This program supports pre-tenure researchers who would like to combine their research efforts with excellent educational programs. Proposals may be submitted annually (July deadline).

The Ocean Education program is the point of contact for anyone interested in submitting Ocean Technical Education, Research Experiences for Teachers (RET), Geoscience Veterans Education and Training Supplements (GEO-VETS), and Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) supplement requests. RET, GEO-VET, and REU supplements are funded through the OCE science programs and have no application deadlines.
