Supports broadening participation and equity in engineering through research, planning and conference grants; mentoring hubs; and centers serving K-12, higher education, nonprofit and industry communities.

Synopsis
Through the Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) Program, NSF seeks to strengthen the future U.S. engineering workforce by enabling and encouraging the participation of all citizens in the engineering enterprise. The BPE Program seeks to support not only research in the science of broadening participation and equity in engineering, but also collaborative endeavors which foster the professional development of a diverse and well-prepared engineering workforce as well as innovative, if not revolutionary, approaches to building capacity through inclusivity and equity within the engineering academic experience.

To solicit the best ideas for these activities, both in formation and enactment, the BPE Program will support projects at various levels of readiness and complexity through the following four tracks: Planning and Conference Grants; Research in Broadening Participation in Engineering; Inclusive Mentoring Hubs (IMHubs); and Centers for Equity in Engineering (CEE). Specific details regarding these pathways can be found in the Program Description.
