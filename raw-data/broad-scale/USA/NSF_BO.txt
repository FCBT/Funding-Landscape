Supports research in biological oceanography and marine ecology in environments ranging from estuarine and coastal systems to the deep sea and the Great Lakes.

Synopsis
The Biological Oceanography Program supports fundamental research in biological oceanography and marine ecology (populations to the ecosystems) broadly defined: relationships among aquatic organisms and their interactions with the environments of the oceans or Great Lakes. Projects submitted to the program are often interdisciplinary efforts that may include participation by other OCE or BIO Programs.
