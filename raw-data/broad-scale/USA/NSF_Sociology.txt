Supports research on social life; the causes and consequences of human behavior; processes of social change; and human social organizations, including groups, institutions and societies.

Synopsis
The Sociology Program supports basic research on all forms of human social organization -- societies, institutions, groups, and demography -- and processes of individual and institutional change. The Program encourages theoretically focused empirical investigations aimed at improving the explanation of fundamental social processes. Included is research on organizations and organizational behavior, population dynamics, social movements, social groups, labor force participation, stratification and mobility, family, social networks, socialization, gender, race, and the sociology of science and technology. The Program supports both original data collections and secondary data analysis that use the full range of quantitative and qualitative methodological tools. Theoretically grounded projects that offer methodological innovations and improvements for data collection and analysis are also welcomed. 

Please Note: Principal Investigators should select PD 98-1331 in the program announcement/solicitation block on the proposal Cover Sheet for submission of regular research projects to the Sociology Program. Projects are evaluated using the two Foundation-wide criteria, intrinsic merit and broader impacts. In assessing the intrinsic merit of proposed research, four components are key to securing support from the Sociology Program: (1) the issues investigated must be theoretically grounded; (2) the research should be based on empirical observation or be subject to empirical validation or illustration; (3) the research design must be appropriate to the questions asked; and (4) the proposed research must advance our understanding of social processes, structures and methods.

The NSF also offers a number of specialized funding opportunities through its crosscutting and cross-directorate activities; some of the Sociology related opportunities are listed below.
