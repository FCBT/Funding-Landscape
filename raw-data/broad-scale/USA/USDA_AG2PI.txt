The National Institute of Food and Agricultureâ€™s Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative (AG2PI) focuses on collaborative science engagement that intends to develop a community of researchers across both crops and animals that will expand knowledge concerning genomes and phenomes of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States. 

Applications that propose a collaboration among U.S. crop and animal researchers are encouraged. Program anticipates funding one proposal in fiscal year 2020.
 
The proposals submitted to AG2PI should aim to achieve one or more of the following goals: 

Study agriculturally significant crops and animals in production environments to achieve sustainable and secure agricultural production;
Ensure that current gaps in existing knowledge of agricultural crop and animal genetics and phenomics are filled;
Identify and develop a functional understanding of relevant genes from animals and agronomically relevant genes from crops that are of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States;
Ensure future genetic improvement of crops and animals of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States;
Study the relevance of diverse germplasm as a source of unique genes that may be of importance in the future;
Enhance genetics to reduce the economic impact of pathogens on crops and animals of importance to the agriculture sector of the United States; and
Provide a foundation for collaborative science across disciplines that benefits both agricultural crop and animal production.
