Program Snapshot
The Common Fund’s Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program is developing a library that catalogs changes that occur when different types of cells are exposed to a variety of agents that disrupt normal cellular functions, called “perturbagens.” This library integrates data across cell types, perturbagens, and measurements of cellular responses and is used by scientists to design and conduct experiments that can help us better understand normal and diseased cellular states and how to alter them.

The wealth of information created by the LINCS program is freely available(link is external) to the research community and is leading to important research discoveries, including new tools for enhancing drug discovery and predicting adverse health events. You can learn how researchers use LINCS data on our Highlights page.

The basic components of biological systems – genes, proteins, and other molecules – work together within cells to sustain normal health and development. These cellular processes are complex and interconnected and can change in response to drugs or environmental stimuli. Understanding how these components are maintained in health, and how they become disrupted and cause disease, is challenging but essential to developing new and better therapies to return biological systems to their normal state. To achieve this goal, LINCS program Data and Signature Generation Centers(link is external) are:
Generating public datasets of five types of cellular signatures after exposure to perturbagens: changes in gene expression (transcriptomics), protein expression (proteomics), protein binding, DNA modifications (epigenomics), and cell shape and movement (imaging)
Developing tools to optimize the accessibility, integration, and utility of LINCS data
Disseminating information about LINCS data (link is external)and tools (link is external)to the broader research community
LINCS also supports a perturbation Data Coordination and Integration Center(link is external) (DCIC) for data curation and integration and community outreach.
