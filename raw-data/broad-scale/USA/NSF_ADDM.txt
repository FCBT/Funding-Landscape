Synopsis
The National Science Foundation (NSF) invites investigators at U.S. organizations to submit proposals for a cooperative agreement for archival of data and access to data and metadata generated through projects funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences Section. Proposals should focus on providing data and metadata ingest services for NSF-funded data providers, data and metadata access services to scientists across disciplines and other Arctic stakeholders (including decision-makers), and data and metadata archival services to ensure that the data is accessible and discoverable in the future.
