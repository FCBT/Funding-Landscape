Supports infrastructure proposals for the following: acquisition or upgrade of research equipment; development of new instrumentation, techniques or software; and community facility support to make complex and expensive instruments.

Synopsis
The NSF Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) hereby solicits proposals for research infrastructure that is necessary to advance understanding of the Earth System including: the structure, properties and dynamics of the solid Earth and the interactions between the solid Earth and its biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere; the history and evolution of life; and the history and dynamics of Earthâ€™s climate.

The EAR Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF) will support meritorious requests for instrument-based and human research infrastructure that will advance understanding of the Earth system, contribute toward training a diverse geoscience workforce, and encourage efforts to support belonging, accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (BAJEDI). 

EAR/IF will consider proposals for:

1) Equipment Acquisition or Upgrade

2) Instrumentation and/or Technique Development

3) Technician Support

4) Community Facility Support

5) Continental Drilling Planning

EAR seeks proposals that prioritize support for the U.S. Earth science community supported by EAR core or special programs (see https://www.nsf.gov/funding/programs.jsp?org=EAR for a current list of funding programs in EAR).
