Synopsis
Arecibo Observatory is a  national research center, supported by NSF and focusing on radio astronomy, planetary radar and upper atmospheric sciences.  Arecibo Observatory is operated and managed for NSF by the Arecibo Observatory Management Team (AOMT).  The AOMT is led by the University of Central Florida (UCF) in partnership with Universidad Ana G. Méndez (UAGM) and Yang Enterprises, Inc. (YEI). The Observatory’s principal observing facilities are 19 kilometers south of the city of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.  Arecibo Observatory provides telescope users with a wide range of instrumentation for research and observation. The center has a permanent staff of scientists, engineers, and technicians who are available to help visiting investigators with their observation programs.

Arecibo Observatory's principal astronomical research instrument is a 305-meter fixed spherical radio/radar telescope, one of the world's largest radio telescope.  Its frequency capabilities range from 50 megahertz to 11 gigahertz.  Transmitters include an S-band (2,380-megahertz) radar system for planetary studies and a 430-megahertz radar system for atmospheric science studies and a heating facility for ionospheric research.  Arecibo Observatory's outreach activities include the popular Angel Ramos Foundation Visitor's Center with interactive exhibits, the only science-oriented facility of its type in Puerto Rico, and summer workshops for science teachers from across the island.
