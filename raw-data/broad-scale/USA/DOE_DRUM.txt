The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Defense-Related Uranium Mines (DRUM) program is a partnership between DOE, federal land management agencies, state abandoned mine lands (AML) programs, and tribal governments to verify and validate the condition of a unique set of abandoned uranium mines. These mines provided uranium ore to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for defense-related activities.

Most mines are located on public land and are abandoned. Initiated in 2017, DRUM Campaign 1 focuses on approximately 2,500 legacy mines located on public land administered by federal and state agencies. Campaign 2 is scheduled to commence fieldwork in fiscal year 2022 and will assess DRUM sites on tribal land. Campaign 3 will assess DRUM sites on private property and is scheduled to begin fieldwork in 2024. The DOE Office of Legacy Management implements the program by conducting verification and validation (V&V) activities, including:

Exchanging information with other federal agencies and state governments to improve the quality of mine-specific data.
Performing field inventories to document the condition of the mines.
Conducting gamma surveys, soil sampling, and water sampling (as applicable), as well as collecting multiple lines of evidence to help evaluate hazards posed by the mines.
Producing mine-specific reports that offer inventory results, as well as evaluations of physical hazards and potential chemical and radiological risks.
Ultimately, these V&V activities will result in preliminary risk screening to assess whether the mines pose potential risks to human health and the environment. This information will be shared with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Forest Service, and state and tribal governments to help them make decisions about how to address mines that pose the greatest risks.
