Synopsis
The Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) plan to support fundamental research in mathematics and statistics necessary to answer questions in the biological and biomedical sciences. Both agencies recognize the need to promote research at the interface between mathematical and life sciences. This program is designed to encourage new collaborations, as well as to support innovative activities by existing teams.

The joint DMS/NIGMS initiative offers two submission tracks: Track 1 - for projects with a total budget of up to $600,000 for an award duration of 3 years, and Track 2 - for projects with a total budget of up to $1,200,000 for an award duration of 3-4 years.
