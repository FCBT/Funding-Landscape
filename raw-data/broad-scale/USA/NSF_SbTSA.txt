Augmenting Science Support on the USCGC Healy

Supports the coordination and delivery of scientific technical support and implements improvements to the technical systems onboard the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Healy.

Synopsis
This solicitation is for proposals to enhance marine science and technical services provided to NSF-supported research cruises on U.S. Coast Guard cutter (USCGC) Healy. U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) provides basic services that will be augmented by the awardee to the level provided by the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) for supporting academic research. This solicitation is for an awardee to perform two primary functions: 1) to plan, coordinate, and deliver science technical support onboard the USCGC Healy, augmenting the role of the USCG marine science technicians and 2) to coordinate with NSF, USCG, and the academic community to provide for the operation, maintenance and upgrade of science equipment installed or used on the USCGC Healy. The awardee is expected to coordinate support among qualified providers as appropriate for specific cruises, utilizing the capabilities and equipment available through the UNOLS system. Ship-based science support will be planned and provided in close coordination with the research teams and USCG personnel with input and approval from NSF.
