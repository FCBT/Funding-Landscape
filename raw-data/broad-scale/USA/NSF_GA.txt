Synopsis
The program in Geometric Analysis supports research on differential geometry and its relation to partial differential equations and variational principles; aspects of global analysis, including the differential geometry of complex manifolds and geometric Lie group theory; geometric methods in modern mathematical physics; and geometry of convex sets, integral geometry, and related geometric topics.

Conferences

Proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, and similar activities must be submitted through the program solicitation "Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences" (link below) and list Geometric Analysis as the program of interest. Principal Investigators should carefully read the solicitation and relevant sections of the PAPPG to obtain important information regarding the substance of such proposals and note the additional requirements for travel support requests for international events.

For these types of proposals with budgets not exceeding $50,000, which in accordance with NSF policy can be reviewed internally at NSF, the following target dates are in effect: For events that will take place between March and August in a given year, proposals should be submitted in September of the previous year. For events that will occur between September in a given year and the last day of February in the following year, the proposal should be submitted in April prior.

Proposals with budget requests that exceed $50,000 are likely to require external review, and hence are subject to longer processing time. These should be submitted roughly seven months before the event is scheduled to take place.
