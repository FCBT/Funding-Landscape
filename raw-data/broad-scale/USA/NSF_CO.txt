Supports research on ocean chemistry and the role of oceans in global geochemical cycles. Focus areas include chemical composition, speciation and transformation; internal cycling; and chemical exchanges with other Earth system components.

Synopsis
The Chemical Oceanography Program supports research into the chemistry of the oceans and the role of the oceans in global geochemical cycles. Areas of interest include chemical composition, speciation, and transformation; chemical exchanges between the oceans and other components of the Earth system; internal cycling in oceans, seas, and estuaries; and the use of measured chemical distributions as indicators of physical, biological, and geological processes.
