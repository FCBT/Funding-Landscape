Supports independent postdoctoral research on any topic supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences and provides professional development with a focus on developing mentoring skills to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in STEM.

Synopsis
The Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) offers postdoctoral research fellowships (PRF) to provide opportunities for scientists early in their careers to work within and across traditional disciplinary lines, develop partnerships, and avail themselves of unique research resources, sites and facilities.  The fellowship program is intended to provide beginning investigators of significant potential with experiences that will establish them in positions of leadership in the scientific community.  During tenure, Fellows affiliate with a host research organization(s) and conduct research on topics supported by OCE. Fellowships will include participation in a professional development program that emphasizes development of mentoring skills and that coordinates the involvement of Fellows in conferences and activities that are focused on increasing the engagement of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Applicants must be U.S. citizens, nationals or permanent residents. Applicants who are women, veterans, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in STEM, or who have attended community colleges and minority-serving institutions (e.g. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, Alaska Native Serving Institutions, and Hawaiian Native and Pacific Islander Serving Institutions) are especially encouraged to apply.
