Supports a resource coordination hub for communities of awardees and prospective awardees of the Education and Human Resources Directorate's Core Research and Building Capacity in STEM Education Research programs.

Synopsis
NSF seeks proposals to create an EHR Core Research (ECR) Resource Coordination Hub (ECR Hub) that will be an intellectual partner to the ECR:Core and the ECR Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR:BCSER) grantee communities and the NSF to enhance the overall influence and reach of ECR science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research investments. The ECR Hub will be expected to work collaboratively with NSF and the ECR:Core and ECR:BCSER communities to design, implement, and execute its activities and ensure the inclusion of diverse researchers representing the full range of our nationâ€™s talent pool, of eligible institutions and organizations and of STEM education research and disciplines funded by ECR. As part of the ECR Program, ECR:Core and ECR:BCSER have multidisciplinary portfolios with research projects from investigators representing a broad range of disciplinary backgrounds and approaches.

The ECR Hub will: support communication among the current and past ECR:Core and ECR:BCSER awardees, prospective awardees, and others doing STEM education research or using STEM education research results; build community and research networks and outreach to new potential researchers and stakeholders;  facilitate information and resource sharing among stakeholders; increase visibility and diffusion of research results from ECR awardees to other stakeholders; and strategically convene stakeholders and coordinate with other NSF resource hubs and centers.
