Synopsis
Supports mathematical research in areas where computation plays a central and essential role, emphasizing analysis, development, and implementation of theoretically justified and efficient algorithms. The combination of these elements resulting in innovative computational methods is a hallmark of the program. Proposals ranging from single investigator to interdisciplinary team projects that not only create and analyze new computational mathematics techniques but also implement them to model, study, and solve important application problems are strongly encouraged, as is providing opportunities for rigorous mathematical training of junior computational mathematicians through research involvement.

Conferences

Proposals to the Computational Mathematics Program for conferences or workshops must be submitted through the program solicitation "Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences" (link below). Principal Investigators should carefully read the solicitation to obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, and similar activities.

Unless an exception from the program is granted, to facilitate timely notification of the availability of support, the following requirements are in effect:

Proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., to be held in the US must be submitted at least 6 months in advance of the conference start date;
Proposals to support group travel to meetings outside the US must be submitted at least 8 months in advance of the meeting start date;
Proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., whose budget request exceeds $50,000 must be submitted during the annual Computational Mathematics Program submission window.
Conference proposals to the Computational Mathematics Program whose submission dates do not conform with the requirements described above will be returned without review.
