Synopsis
Synthetic Biology is an interdisciplinary research area that has the potential to impact innovation and technological progress and be a cornerstone of the bioeconomy.   To enhance rapid advances in this field and to aid the development of common practices and standards in this emerging technology, it is desirable to facilitate the formation of international teams of collaborators. Therefore, NSF will participate in the ERASynBio 1st joint call for transnational research projects.   Additional information, including procedures for submitting electronic proposals is available at the ERASynBio portal.

ERASynBio is a European Research Area Network (ERA-Net) from the seventh framework program for the development and coordination of Synthetic Biology in the European Research Area. The central idea of ERASynBio is to promote the robust development of Synthetic Biology by structuring and coordinating national efforts and investments.

The deadline for ERASynBio applications is August 26, 2013; proposals are submitted through a link available at http://www.erasynbio.eu/index.php?index=17.
