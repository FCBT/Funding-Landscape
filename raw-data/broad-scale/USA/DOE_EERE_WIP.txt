Saving Energy and Money for American Homes, Communities, Businesses, and Industries
The Weatherization and Intergovernmental Programs Office (WIP) is part of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and supports a national energy strategy to create greater energy affordability, security, and resiliency.

WIP's mission is to enable strategic investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies with innovative practices across the United States by a wide range of stakeholders, in partnership with state and local organizations and community-based non-profits.

WIP is made up of two programs focused on state and local governments—the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and the State Energy Program (SEP)—and two teams that develop and deliver targeted technical assistance and strategic initiatives to state and local governments. Learn more.
