What is SBIR and STTR?
If you are new to DOE SBIR/STTR, please get started by watching our two minute Programs Overview Video.

The SBIR and STTR programs are U.S. Government programs, intended to help certain small businesses conduct R&D. At DOE, funding takes the form of grants. Projects must have the potential for commercialization and meet specific DOE mission-specific R&D needs.

DOE offers more than sixty technical topics and 250 subtopics, spanning research areas that support the DOE mission in:

Energy Production
Energy Use
Fundamental Energy Sciences
Environmental Management, and
Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation
