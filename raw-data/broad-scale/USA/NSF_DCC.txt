Synopsis
The Dynamics, Controls and Cognition (DCC) Cluster supports fundamental research on the modeling, analysis, diagnostics, measurement, and control of dynamical systems, including but not limited to those involving physical interaction between human and embodied artificial intelligences. Support is expected to lead to new theories, methods, and engineering applications with broad societal impacts.  Interdisciplinary, convergent proposals are welcome.  Proposals of all sizes will therefore be considered as justified by the project description. Investigators are encouraged to discuss their ideas with DCC program directors well in advance of submission.
