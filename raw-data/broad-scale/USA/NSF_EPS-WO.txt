Through this program, NSF establishes partnerships with government, higher education, and industry that are designed to effect sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction's research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&D) capacity, and hence, its R&D competitiveness. Eligibility to participate in the EPSCoR Workshop Opportunities program is described according to the Outreach Eligibility Map (see eligibility map). 

EPSCoR welcomes proposals for workshops from institutions within EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions.   These workshops will focus on innovative ways to address multi-jurisdictional efforts on themes of regional to national importance with relevance to EPSCoR's goals and NSF's mission.
