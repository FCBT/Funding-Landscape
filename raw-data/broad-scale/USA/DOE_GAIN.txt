What is GAIN?
The Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) is a framework for establishing private-public partnerships. We are at an exciting time in the history of nuclear energy with a surge of companies working to bring new, innovative technologies to the marketplace. Our national laboratories hold decades of experience in nuclear technology development, unique research capabilities, and some of the top scientists in the field.

GAIN bridges the gap between innovators in the private sector and the world-class research capabilities of our national laboratories. It offers industry partners a single point of access to the nuclear expertise and facilities at the labs and ensures the work done at our national labs has a real impact on the future of nuclear energy technology.

By leveraging our national laboratories, GAIN is accelerating new, innovative nuclear energy technologies toward market readiness.
