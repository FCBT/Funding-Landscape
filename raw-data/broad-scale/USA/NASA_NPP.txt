NASA Postdoc Program
The NASA Postdoctoral Program, Support Contractors, Key NASA Personnel

For more than 15 years, the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) at NASA Headquarters has collaborated with 1) other Mission Directorates (Aeronautics, Space Technology, etc.); 2) Headquarters’ Offices; 3) NASA Centers; 4) the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL); and 5) beyond-NASA, non-federal organizations, to monitor contractors, i.e., Universities Space Research Association (USRA) or Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU), who support the day-to-day operations for the NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP).

NASA periodically competes NPP support, and the most recent Request for Proposals, Source Selection Statement, etc., for solicitation number: 80HQTR20R0013 entitled “Final RFP NASA Postdoctoral Program-2 (NPP-2)” may be downloaded from SAM.gov. The NPP contract provides: 1) Materials, facilities, supplies, administrative support, programmatic support, and expertise necessary to promote and administer the NASA Postdoctoral Research Program (NPRP) and the NASA Postdoctoral Management Program (NPMP);  2) Foreign National employment expertise;  3) Online Web services creation, improvement, and design;  4) Development and maintenance of online applications;  5)  In depth participant tracking and accounting;  and 6) Administration of an efficient, professional, and fair selection process.

While NASA announced the selection of a new, i.e., NPP-2 contractor, the correct effective date for the new contract with ORAU is on or about January 30, 2022.   A 90-day transition period with the out-going contractor (USRA), or NPP-1 has ended. USRA no longer supports current and prospective Fellows. Please visit the NPP-2 website hosted by ORAU for details about program eligibility,  future application deadlines, etc.
