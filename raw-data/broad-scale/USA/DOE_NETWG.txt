The Nuclear Energy Tribal Working Group (NETWG) is a chartered working group, focused on engaging tribal governments interested in the broad spectrum of Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear energy activities. NETWG explores such topics as nuclear research and development, small module reactors, stakeholder outreach, STEM education, emergency response and planning activities, and potential economic business opportunities. 

About NETWG
NETWG was established in December 2014 to bring officials from the Office of Nuclear Energy and tribal leaders together to collaborate and gain insight into real-time tribal experiences representing obstacles and opportunities in nuclear energy and related infrastructure development in Indian Country.

The mission of NETWG is to engage federally recognized tribal governments and their designated representatives in DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy activities. NETWG serves as a conduit to foster communication, education of all generations, and promote active involvement of tribal governments. NETWG is dedicated to assisting in developing and maintaining the government-to-government relationship between DOE and Indian tribes, consistent with DOEâ€™s American Indian policy.

NETWG is hosted, managed, and supported as a program initiative in the Office of Nuclear Energy. It is also supported by the National Conference of State Legislatures through a cooperative agreement.
