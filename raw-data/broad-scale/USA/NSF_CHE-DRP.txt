Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) proposals should be submitted through the CAREER solicitation (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214) by the CAREER deadline date specified.

Facilitating Research at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions: Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) and Research Opportunity Awards (ROA) proposals should be submitted through the RUI/ROA solicitation (https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5518) during the window for the appropriate CHE Disciplinary Research Program. In addition to the requirements of the RUI program, proposals should follow the guidance in this solicitation.

Proposals for Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER), Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID), Research Advanced by Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (RAISE), and conferences can be submitted anytime after consultation with the cognizant NSF Program Officer.

Supplemental funding requests to existing grants can be submitted anytime after consultation with the cognizant NSF Program Officer. Until this capability is implemented in Research.gov, supplemental funding requests must still be prepared and submitted via FastLane.
