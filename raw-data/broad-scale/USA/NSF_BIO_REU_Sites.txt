Supports research and mentoring experiences for undergraduate students to broaden participation in the biological sciences.

Synopsis
The Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) participates in the NSF-wide REU program. The Division for Biological Infrastructure (DBI) manages the REU Site program for BIO.

The NSF-wide Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) solicitation governs the overall competition. The following clarifications/explanations are specifically for REU Site proposals submitted to the BIO/DBI.   

A BIO-funded REU Site hosts on average 10 students for a summer program lasting approximately 10 weeks long.
In BIO, at least 50% of participants must come from outside the host institution.
Stipend, meal allowance and travel to and from the REU site must be budgeted. A small research allowance of $1,000-2,000 per student can be added to Participant Support costs.
Travel to conferences to present student research should NOT be included in the budget. Travel funds to students are provided through a Travel Award system administered in the https://bioreu.org website.
Over the past several years, Site awards to institutions have the predominant costs under the Participant Support Costs (PSC); typically, PSC constitute 90% or more of the Total Direct Costs.
Most awards provide 3 years of funding. Proposers wanting to request more than 3 years of support should contact the Program Directors.
Assessment of BIO-funded REU Sites is done using the Student Assessment of Their Learning Gains Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (SALG URSSA) tool (see the https://bioreu.org website for details).
