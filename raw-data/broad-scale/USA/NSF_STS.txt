Supports historical, philosophical and social scientific studies of the intellectual, material and social aspects of STEM — including ethics, equity, governance and policy issues relating to scientific theory and practice.

Synopsis
The Science and Technology Studies (STS) program supports research that uses historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods to investigate the intellectual, material, and social facets of the scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical (STEM) disciplines. It encompasses a broad spectrum of topics including interdisciplinary studies of ethics, equity, governance, and policy issues that are closely related to STEM disciplines. 

The program’s review process is approximately six months. It includes appraisal of proposals by ad hoc reviewers selected for their expertise and by an advisory panel that meets twice a year. The deadlines for the submission of proposals are February 2nd for proposals to be funded as early as July, and August 3rd for proposals to be funded in or after January. There is one exception: Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant proposals will have only one deadline per year, August 3rd.

The Program encourages potential investigators with questions about the program to contact one of the Cognizant Program Directors. Potential investigators who have concerns about whether their proposal fits the goals of the program are encouraged to send a one-page prospectus of their proposal idea to the Cognizant Program Directors. Guidelines for developing one-page prospectuses are provided below under Guidelines for Developing Effective STS Proposals.
