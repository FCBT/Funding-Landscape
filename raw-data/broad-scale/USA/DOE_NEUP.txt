General Information
The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Office of Nuclear Energy created Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) in 2009 to consolidate its university support under one program.

NEUP funds nuclear energy research and equipment upgrades at U.S. colleges and universities, and provides student educational support.

NEUP plays a key role in helping the Department of Energy accomplish its mission of leading the nation's investment in the development and exploration of advanced nuclear science and technology.

The Department promotes nuclear energy as a resource capable of meeting the nation's energy, environmental and national security needs by resolving technical, cost, safety, security and proliferation resistance through research, development and demonstration.
