Supports social scientific studies of the connections between law and law-like systems of rules, law and human behavior, as well as studies of how science and technology are applied in legal contexts.

Synopsis
The Law & Science Program considers proposals that address social scientific studies of law and law-like systems of rules, as well as studies of how science and technology are applied in legal contexts. The Program is inherently interdisciplinary and multi-methodological. Successful proposals describe research that advances scientific theory and understanding of the connections between human behavior and law, legal institutions, or legal processes; or the interactions of law and basic sciences, including biology, computer and information sciences, STEM education, engineering, geosciences, and math and physical sciences. Scientific studies of law often approach law as dynamic, interacting with multiple arenas, and with the participation of multiple actors. Fields of study include many disciplines, and often address problems including, though not limited, to:

Crime, Violence, and Policing
Cyberspace
Economic Issues
Environmental Science
Evidentiary Issues
Forensic Science
Governance and Courts
Human Rights and Comparative Law
Information Technology
Legal and Ethical Issues related to Science
Legal Decision Making
Legal Mobilization and Conceptions of Justice
Litigation and the Legal Profession
Punishment and Corrections
Regulation and Facilitation of Biotechnology (e.g., Gene Editing, Gene Testing, Synthetic Biology) and Other Emerging Sciences and Technologies
Use of Science in the Legal Processes
LS supports the following types of proposals:

Standard Research Grants and Grants for Collaborative Research
Conference Awards
LS also participates in a number of specialized funding opportunities through NSFâ€™s cross-cutting and cross-directorate activities, including, for example:   

Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID)
Early-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER)
