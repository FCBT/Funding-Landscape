The Gravitational Physics programs (Gravitational Physics - Theory, Gravitational Physics – Experiments and Data Analysis, and LIGO Research Support) support research at the frontiers of science aimed towards answering questions about the nature of space and time, the gravitational attraction and the use of gravitational waves (GW) to explore the universe.

The LIGO Research Support program oversees the commissioning and operation of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and provides support for the development of its instrumentation. This includes tasks that range from instrument science and detector characterization to the study and development of technologies for future generations of GW detectors. This excludes LIGO data analysis that is funded through the Gravitational Physics – Experiments and Data Analysis program.

In addition, the program supports infrastructure activities such as visitor programs, workshops, and research centers involving the participation of external scientists from universities, national laboratories, and industry, as well as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
