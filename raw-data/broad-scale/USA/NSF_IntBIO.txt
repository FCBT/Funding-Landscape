Supports collaborative research, training and education that spans subdisciplines to understand how biological systems function and interact across different scales of organization.

Synopsis
This solicitation invites submission of collaborative proposals that tackle bold questions in biology and require an integrated approach to make substantive progress. Integrative biological research spans subdisciplines and incorporates cutting-edge methods, tools, and concepts from each to produce groundbreaking biological discovery. The research should be synergistic and produce novel, holistic understanding of how biological systems function and interact across different scales of organization, e.g., from molecules to cells, tissues to organisms, species to ecosystems and the entire Earth. Such knowledge is critical to inform solutions to societal challenges, including natural resource management, resilience to environmental change, and global food security. Outcomes from integrative research will also inform and guide the development of new technologies that drive the nationâ€™s bioeconomy.

Integrative biological research depends on researchers who work in dynamic, diverse, and collaborative interdisciplinary teams. These teams should be fully engaged in the training and education of the next generation of scientists who will be future leaders in integrative research. A vibrant, inclusive, and integrative training environment will therefore produce a new generation of researchers who can navigate across subdisciplines and engage in integrative thinking.
