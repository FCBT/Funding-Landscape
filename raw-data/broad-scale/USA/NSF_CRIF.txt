Synopsis
The Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) provides funds to research institutions and consortia thereof for the purchase of multi-user instruments and for the establishment and support of multi-user research facilities in the chemical sciences. This Program is structured to enable the National Science Foundation, through its Division of Chemistry, to respond to a variety of needs for infrastructure to undergird advanced research and education in chemistry. The NSF Division of Chemistry supports education and research activities in analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, materials, and surface chemistry. Instrumentation for related fields of research is provided through other NSF programs. 

NOTE:  The CRIF program is temporarily suspended.
