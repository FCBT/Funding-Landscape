Supports the development of community cyberinfrastructure to advance research and education in the Earth sciences.

Synopsis
The Division of Earth Sciences (EAR) will consider proposals for the development of cyberinfrastructure (CI) for the Earth Sciences (Geoinformatics). EAR-supported geoinformatics opportunities will fit into three tracks: Catalytic Track, Facility Track, and Sustainability Track. These tracks broadly support the lifecycle of geoinformatics resource development, from pilots (Catalytic) to broad implementation (Facility) to sunsetting and long-term sustainability (Sustainability).

The GI Catalytic Track will support pilot geoinformatics development efforts that are intended to serve Earth Science research.

The GI Facility Track will support awards for implementation and operation of a cyberinfrastructure resource relied upon by one or more Earth Science communities to address science questions.

The GI Sustainability Track will support development and implementation of sustainable funding models to preserve data and software products of value to Earth Science research.
