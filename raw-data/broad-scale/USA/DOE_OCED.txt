Mission
The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was established in December 2021 with a mission to deliver clean energy demonstration projects at scale in partnership with the private sector to launch or accelerate market adoption and deployment of technologies, as part of an equitable transition to a decarbonized energy system.

OCED is a technology-neutral office that serves as a project management center of excellence, implementing key multi-billion dollar demonstration projects in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, as well as supporting the applied programs and other offices to ensure a consistent approach to implementing capital intensive late-stage technology demonstrations across the Department of Energy (DOE). OCED supports commercial-scale demonstration projects that have viability at scale and an expectation of achieving cost competitiveness and bankability. OCED investments are part of a clear progression between the research, development, and early-stage demonstration projects within DOE technology offices and initial deployments supported by the private sector or other programs, such as the Loan Programs Office, ensuring coherent strategies for advancing and deploying clean energy technologies and systems. Funding decisions are made to support scalable outcomes that lead to commercialization and deployment, while focusing on greenhouse gas emission reductions, job creation, environmental justice and Justice40 Initiative priorities, and energy transition communities.

OCED is hiring federal employees and contractors from all backgrounds across America to help tackle the climate crisis, create good-paying American jobs, and spur economic growth.
