Synopsis
The Applied Mathematics program supports mathematics research motivated by or having an effect on problems arising in science and engineering. Mathematical merit and novelty, as well as breadth and quality of impact on applications, are important factors. Proposals to develop critical mathematical techniques from individual investigators as well as from interdisciplinary teams are encouraged.

Proposals whose primary applications are in the biological sciences are inappropriate for Applied Mathematics, and should be submitted elsewhere; see the synopsis of the DMS Mathematical Biology program on that program's webpage for further guidance.

Conferences

Proposals to the Applied Mathematics program for conferences or workshops should be submitted through the program solicitation "Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences" (link below).  Principal Investigators should carefully read the program solicitation to obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, and similar activities.

To facilitate timely notification of the availability of support:

Proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., to be held in the US must be submitted 8 months in advance of the conference date;
Proposals to support group travel to meetings outside the US must be submitted 12 months in advance of the meeting date;
Proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., whose budget request exceeds $50,000 must be submitted during the annual November 1-15 submission window.
