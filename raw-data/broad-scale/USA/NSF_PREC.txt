Synopsis
The CHE Partnerships for Research and Education in Chemistry (PREC) program aims to enable, build, and grow partnerships between minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and CHE-supported Centers for Chemical Innovation, NSF's ChemMatCARS, the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI), or the Molecule Maker Lab Institute (MMLI) to increase recruitment, retention and degree attainment (which defines the PREC pathway) by members of those groups most underrepresented in chemistry research, and at the same time support excellent research and education endeavors that strengthen such partnerships.

The PREC program includes two Tracks to catalyze the development of research and educational endeavors at MSIs as well as to improve the PREC pathway. Track 1 focuses efforts on establishing and strengthening the PREC pathway through smaller research and education collaborations. Track 2 includes improvements and expansions of the PREC pathway while also building larger collaborations and capacity for research at the MSIs with support for the integration of research and education efforts.
