The Advanced Manufacturing Office is the only technology development office within the U.S. Government that is dedicated to improving the energy and material efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness of manufacturers across the industrial sector.

AMO brings together manufacturers, not-for-profit entities, research organizations, and institutions of higher education to identify challenges; catalyze innovations; and develop cutting-edge material, process, and information technologies needed for an efficient and competitive domestic manufacturing sector. By targeting efficient manufacturing technologies, AMO seeks to drive energy productivity improvements in the U.S. manufacturing sector, efficiently utilize abundant and available domestic energy resources, and support the manufacture of clean energy products with benefits extending across the economy.

AMO pursues its goals through three subprogram approaches: individual Advanced Manufacturing Applied Research and Development (R&D) Projects, pre-commercial Advanced Manufacturing R&D Consortia, and Technical Partnerships.

AMO supports EEREâ€™s strategic goal to promote American energy dominance through affordable and reliable energy production and use, which advances economic growth and energy security.
