Supports research on the formation of planet Earth, including its accretion, early differentiation, and its petrologic and geochemical modification via igneous and metamorphic processes.

Synopsis
The Petrology and Geochemistry Program supports basic research on the formation of planet Earth, including its accretion, early differentiation, and subsequent petrologic and geochemical modification via igneous and metamorphic processes. Proposals in this program generally address the petrology and high-temperature geochemistry of igneous and metamorphic rocks and minerals (including mantle samples), mineral physics, economic geology, and volcanology. Proposals that are focused on the development of analytical tools, theoretical and computational models, and experimental techniques for applications by the igneous and metamorphic petrology, and high temperature geochemistry and geochronology communities are also invited. The program supports a wide range of Broader Impacts activities, including (but not limited to) infrastructure enhancement, partnerships with industry, and evidence-based practices that recruit and specifically retain individuals who historically have not been included in the geosciences.
