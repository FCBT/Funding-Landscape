Synopsis
The Algebra and Number Theory program supports research in algebra, algebraic and arithmetic geometry, number theory, and representation theory.

Conferences

Principal Investigators should carefully read the program solicitation "Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences" (link below) to obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, and similar activities. 

For conference proposals with budgets not exceeding $50,000, which in accordance with NSF policy can be reviewed internally at NSF, the following target dates are in effect:  For events that will take place between March and December in a given year, proposals should be submitted in October of the previous year. For events that will occur in January or February of a given year, proposals should be submitted in May of the preceding year. In order to allow time for external review, conference proposals with budget requests exceeding $50,000 should be submitted roughly seven months before the event is scheduled to take place.

For fiscal year 2021, the October target dates for conference proposals are waived in view of the current pandemic. Conference proposals for meetings with budget requests not exceeding $50,000 should be submitted at least four months in advance of the event.
