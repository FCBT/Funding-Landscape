The Office of Carbon Management’s mission is to facilitate a just and environmentally sustainable transition toward a net-zero carbon economy. How do we do this? By focusing on carbon dioxide -- its storage, containment, and capture. We address emissions associated with the power and industrial sectors, as well as legacy emissions in the atmosphere, and we seek to permanently store and/or convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to reduce negative climate impacts.

Activities to deliver the Office’s mission center on investments in technological readiness and analysis. To do so, our department researches a portfolio of carbon management approaches, with an emphasis on facilitating development of approaches that meet our technical, justice, and sustainability requirements for commercialization. Our goals are to improve their performance, reduce costs, and scale the deployment of the technologies to decarbonize the power and industrial sectors and to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. 

The Office of Carbon Management comprises two major offices:

The Office of Carbon Management Technologies leads and invests in research, development, demonstration, and deployment across five divisions: Point Source Carbon Capture; Carbon Transport and Storage; Carbon Dioxide Removal and Conversion; Hydrogen with Carbon Management; and Integrated Carbon Management.

The Office of Strategic Planning, Analysis and Engagement leads in strategic activities and international and intra-governmental coordination across two divisions: Systems, Economic and Environmental Analysis and Strategic Engagement. More information on the work performed in our divisions can be found below.
