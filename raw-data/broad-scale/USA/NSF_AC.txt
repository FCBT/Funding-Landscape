Supports research on atmospheric gases and aerosols, including sources and sinks; transport and chemical reactions of atmospheric species; atmospheric photochemistry; heterogeneous reactions; and aqueous-phase chemistry and aerosol processes.

Synopsis
Supports research to measure and model the concentration and distribution of gases and aerosols in the atmosphere. Also, supports research on chemical reactions among atmospheric species; sources and sinks of important trace gases and aerosols; transport of gases and aerosols throughout the atmosphere; atmospheric photochemistry, heterogeneous reactions, aqueous-phase chemistry and aerosol processes; and improved methods for measuring the concentrations of trace species and their fluxes into and out of the atmosphere.
