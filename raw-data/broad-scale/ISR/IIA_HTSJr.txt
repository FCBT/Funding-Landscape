In response to the shortage of skilled personnel for the Israeli high-tech industry, the Innovation Authority has launched the high-tech internship incentive program that provides grants to support high-tech companies that create employee specialization programs.
As part of these programs, new graduates with a university degree or a degree in practical engineering in technology professions (“juniors”) will be accepted and trained for entry-level development roles. The juniors’ training model will be adapted to the company’s needs and may be based on the company’s internal resources and/or external organizations and trainers.

Goal of the incentive program
To integrate new technology profession graduates from higher education institutions into development roles in high-tech companies, as part of the effort to combat the shortage of skilled professionals in the Israeli high-tech industry.

Who is the incentive program for?
High-tech companies with up to 1,000 employees in Israel.
High-tech companies with 30 or more R&D employees or that have received a grant from the Innovation Authority in selected programs.
Most of the company’s activity is not R&D activity commissioned by another client.
What do you get?
NIS 50,000 for a candidate eligible for internship, for a period of six months.
Why should you apply to this incentive program?
Financial support: participation of the Innovation Authority in the cost of new employees’ training and internship.
Internal training processes: encouraging companies to create internal training processes for new employees that are suitable to the company’s specific needs.
Training program: the training program may include (new or existing) internal training or training with an external training supplier. The training program and its subjects will be determined by the company and in accordance with its needs.
