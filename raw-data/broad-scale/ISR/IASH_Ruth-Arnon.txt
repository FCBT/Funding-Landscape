Ruth Arnon Fellowships
Ruth Arnon Postdoctoral Fellowships for Adams Fellowships Alumnae
Acquiring postdoctoral training abroad, a crucial step in advancing their career tracks, may pose a particular challenge to Israelâ€™s promising young women scientists. In 2016, Prof. Ruth Arnon, former Israel Academy President and Chair of the CHE's Committee for Furthering Women in Institutions for Higher Education, resolved to encourage and support Adams alumnae seeking to travel abroad for postdoctoral training by establishing a dedicated fund to assist them. Awardees, selected solely on the basis of excellence in research, receive fellowships of $20,000 USD.
