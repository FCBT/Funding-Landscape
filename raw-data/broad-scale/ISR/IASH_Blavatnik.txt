The Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists honor exceptional young scientists and engineers in three disciplines - Life Sciences, Physical Sciences & Engineering, and Chemistry - by highlighting their extraordinary achievements, recognizing exceptional promise for future discoveries, and accelerating innovation through one of the largest unrestricted prizes ever created for early-career researchers. The prizes are awarded annually to three outstanding scientists, aged 42 years or younger, who each receive US$100,000.
 
The Blavatnik Awards were established in 2007 by the Blavatnik Family Foundation to honor and celebrate exceptional young scientists (faculty and post-doctoral) in the United States. In March 2017, marking a decade since the establishment of the awards and as part of a cooperation agreement between the New York Academy of Sciences and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, it was announced that the Blavatnik Awards will also be offered in Israel.
 
All of Israel’s universities may nominate candidates for the awards. Administered jointly by the New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (IASH), the Blavatnik Awards program in Israel is overseen by a Scientific Advisory Council co-chaired by Israel Academy member and Nobel Prize Laureate Prof. Aaron Ciechanover and NYAS President and CEO Nicholas B. Dirks. Israeli members of the Scientific Advisory Council are Israel Academy President Prof. David Harel, Former Academy President Prof. Nili Cohen, Prof. Issac Ben Israel and Israel Academy members Prof. Adi Kimchi, Prof. Moti Segev and Prof. Itamar Willner. The Jury chairs are Academy Members Prof. Naama Barkai, Prof. Yosef Kost, and Prof. Micha Sharir.
 
Three Israeli winners are chosen annually by disciplinary juries comprising some of the world’s most distinguished scientists and engineers and are recognized as Blavatnik Awards Laureates.
