Industrial R&D Cooperation with European Countries
As Israel’s number one trading partner, Europe is a continent rich in opportunities for Israeli industry. European countries, the EU and Israel have a long history of successful and groundbreaking technological and scientific cooperation in a number of fields – much of which is a result of the many bilateral cooperation agreements between Israel and European countries, along with Israel’s membership in a number of multinational programs for collaboration in industrial R&D. Europe is to date Israel's main partner for collaborative industrial R&D projects, allowing Israeli companies to access know how, R&D infrastructure and access to world markets together with European partners. 
  

In fact, ISERD implements a large number of bilateral agreements with European countries and regions, and Israeli companies can collaborate with companies in any European country through industrial R&D programs like EUREKA and Eurostars. Around 100 new projects are approved and funded every year in these programs.
