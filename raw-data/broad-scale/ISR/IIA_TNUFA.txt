What do you get?

Entrepreneurs and new Israeli startup companies can receive a conditional grant of up to NIS 200,000 over a period of two years: NIS 100,000 awarded each year (85% of the approved budget).
The funds will be used for building an initial prototype, intellectual property protection and business development, including materials, degradable components, sub-contractors and consultants, patent attorneys and exhibition expenses (not intended for salaries and overhead expenses).
Why should you apply for this program?

Benefits: The entrepreneurs are not obliged to leave their current job to establish a company as a condition for receiving the support or to give up rights to the project.

Credibility mark: The support of the Tnufa program is an objective vote of confidence, that can help entrepreneurs raise additional capital following the initial funding provided by the program.

Follow-on funding by the Authority: Following the completion of the program’s support period, the project may receive support from one of the other programs offered by the Authority.

Attractive funding model: The incentive program offers participation in the risks involved in the company’s development process but not in future profits or successes. A company undertakes to repay the grants received by the Authority via royalty payments from product sales.
