About the Collaboration  

It was stated in Government Resolution No. 4481 [dated January 2019], that Israel shall collaborate with the World Economic Forum and will become part of the C4IR – Centre for the 4th Industrial Revolution to promote the use of agile regulation for advanced technologies. The Israel Innovation Authority was chosen to serve as the hosting entity for C4IR IL, due to its familiarity and close collaboration with the Israeli tech industry. In support of this goal, C4IR Israel works with Israel’s Ministry of Transportation (MOT) to advance its regulatory landscape in rapid transition towards a shared, electric and automated mobility ecosystem. As part of the collaboration, C4IR generates policy papers, encourages multi stakeholder collaborations and best practice exchange with different foreign regulators and industry, and assisting MOT in shaping its regulatory framework for the trials and operations of AVs in Israel.

The Innovation 

Bringing together Israeli regulators with global and local industry and foreign regulators, to exchange best practices and create a multi- stakeholder collaboration for the shaping of a bottom- up regulatory framework for av’s in Israel that will meet industry needs yet ensure public interest.
