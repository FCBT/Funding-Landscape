The EU Horizon 2020 Program seeks to create collaboration in areas of research, development, and innovation between Israeli and European entities from industry, academia, research institutes, and public and private organizations.
ISERD, the Israel-Europe Research and Innovation Directorate, is responsible for promoting Israeli activity in the European research arena and strives to provide Israeli entities with access to the European Framework Program. Further information on the program, events’ schedule, monthly explanatory presentations, and contact details for each technological field can be found on the ISERD website.

The Framework Program – Horizon 2020, operating between 2014-2020, constitutes the world’s largest platform for funding research, development, and innovation, with a total budget of 77 billion Euros over the past 7 years.
