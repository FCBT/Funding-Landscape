About the program
The program assists in publishing research results in book format in the areas of arts and humanities, discourse analysis and quality communications. The Israel Science Foundation (ISF) will help fund the publishing as well as assist with pre-publication, including translation, editing and illustrations. Submitted material may be the conclusion of long-term research or a collection of papers published for the first time. In this case, the names of the authors (name and institution) should be included.
A book published under the auspices of this program should not be part of a larger anthology series; commemorative works or proceedings are not suitable.
