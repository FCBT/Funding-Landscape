Funding research

The ANRS funds research projects and provides grants in all areas of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis research. Each year, the agency puts out two calls for research proposals, which, together with grant applications, are reviewed by international advisory boards and scientific committees. Overall, about one-third of submitted proposals or applications are approved and funded.

Promoting results
Texte

ANRS-funded projects yield scientific publications, which, depending on the year, rank second and third in the world for HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis research, respectively, and approximately 7% of ANRS-supported publications are in the "top 1% of excellence." The ANRS is careful to promote the research results so that they benefit vulnerable populations affected by HIV/AIDS and viral hepatitis.
