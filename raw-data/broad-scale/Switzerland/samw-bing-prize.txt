 The Robert Bing Prize is financed by the legacy of the Basel neurologist Robert Bing (1878–1956). In accordance with the donor's will, the prize honours outstanding work in the recognition, treatment and cure of diseases of the nervous system.

The research must be of excellent quality, original, innovative and topical. Candidates should be Swiss or have been working in Switzerland for a significant amount of time.

 

The Prize is awarded every two years with a prize money of CHF 50'000.– for a single laureate or CHF 30'000.– each if two laureates are distinguished simultaneously.
