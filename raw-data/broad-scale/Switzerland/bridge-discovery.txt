The funding scheme "BRIDGE Discovery" fosters projects that aim to establish, explore and implement
the innovation potential of research results. It supports qualified researchers who intend to conduct a
research and innovation project with the clear goal of developing an application, a service, a method or a
process.
2 BRIDGE Discovery supports interactions between basic and applied research to implement the innovation
potential of scientific results. Cooperation between universities, the Swiss federal institutes of technology,
research institutes, universities of applied sciences (UAS) and universities of teacher education (UTE) will be
considered a positive feature in the evaluation process and is one of the evaluation criteria.
3 The evaluation criteria also include a commitment to sustainable development (including economic, societal
and environmental consequences) in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the
United Nations.2
4 BRIDGE Discovery projects may cover any type of innovation or research field, except clinical studies.
