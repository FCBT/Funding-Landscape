 Bilateral projects with Israel

Switzerland’s cooperation with Israel gained momentum since Israel’s accession to EUREKA in 2000. To concretize the collaborations, Innosuisse cooperates with the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) within the framework of the Joint Declaration of Intent signed in Bern on 14 June 2018 and to carry out joint innovation projects.

The objective of this agreement is to encourage collaboration between Swiss and Israeli companies and research organisations to promote the exchange of knowledge and expertise, to establish sustainable partnerships and to increase business development opportunities.
Support for Swiss-Israeli projects

The agreement allows Innosuisse and IIA to intensify the existing cooperation in technological and science-based innovation between companies, research institutes and other entities from Switzerland and Israel. Swiss-Israeli project partnerships are created within the framework of the respective national programmes, support instruments as well as the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN).
Cooperation implementation

The main objective of these partnerships is to raise the level of technological competence and innovation capabilities of companies and research organisations in both countries. This allows companies to increase their competitive advantage through the development of new products, improved technical processes or solutions.

It is the responsibility of Innosuisse and IIA to seek to support projects ranging from experimental Proof of Concept to proven technology, which will result in products, technical processes or solutions that are significantly different from already available products, technical processes or services. These innovations must offer added value to the economy, society, or the environment.
