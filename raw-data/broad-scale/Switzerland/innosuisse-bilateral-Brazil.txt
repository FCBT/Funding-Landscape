 Bilateral projects with Brazil

Innosuisse cooperates with the Brazilian innovation agency to carry out joint innovation projects. Innosuisse and Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa e Inovação Industrial (EMBRAPII) have signed a cooperation agreement in Brasilia on 8 November 2019.

The objective of this agreement is to encourage collaboration between Swiss and Brazilian companies and research organisations to promote the exchange of knowledge and expertise, to establish sustainable partnerships and to increase business development opportunities.
Support for Swiss-Brazilian projects

The agreement allows Innosuisse and EMBRAPII to intensify the existing cooperation in the fields of technology and innovation. Swiss-Brazilian partnerships for research and development (R&D) projects conducted by companies and research organisations are created within the framework of national programmes and support instruments as well as the EEN (Enterprise Europe Network).
Promoting innovation

The main objective of these partnerships is to raise the level of technological competence and innovation capabilities of companies and research organisations in both countries. This allows companies to increase their competitive advantage through the development of new products, improved technical processes or solutions.

It is the responsibility of Innosuisse and EMBRAPII to seek to support projects ranging from experimental Proof of Concept to proven technology, which will result in products, technical processes or solutions that are significantly different from already available products, technical processes or services. These innovations must offer added value to the economy, society, or the environment.
Cooperation implementation

Together, Innosuisse and EMBRAPII promote this cooperation through annual calls for proposals. The call announcements, evaluation of funding applications and the follow-up of Swiss-Brazilian R&D projects are also jointly coordinated.
