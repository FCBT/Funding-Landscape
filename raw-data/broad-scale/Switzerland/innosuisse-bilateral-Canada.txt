 Bilateral projects with Canada

Switzerland and Canada have signed the Science, Technology & Innovation (STI) joint statement on 25 January 2018 in Davos to strengthen bilateral cooperation. In recognition of this STI joint statement, Innosuisse cooperates with the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) to carry out joint innovation projects.

The purpose of this agreement is to enhance collaboration between Swiss and Canadian knowledge-based institutions, intermediary organisations and industry on the basis of mutual gain, following a bottom-up approach.
Objective

The objectives are to encourage the sharing of best practices between the innovation ecosystems of both countries, facilitate advanced R&D&I collaborations in areas of mutual interest, help build partnerships in converting advanced research into commercial applications, support efforts to integrate stakeholders from both countries and foster matchmaking at selected events and initiatives.
Support for Swiss-Canadian projects

The agreement allows Innosuisse and NRC-IRAP to intensify the existing cooperation in the fields of technology and innovation. Swiss-Canadian partnerships for research and development (R&D) projects conducted by companies and research organisations are created within the framework of EUREKA framework and support instruments as well as the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN).
Forms of Cooperation

It is the responsibility of Innosuisse and NRC-IRAP to promote the exchange of STI knowledge and expertise through joint events, to establish sustainable partnerships through matchmaking initiatives and to seek collaborative projects ranging from experimental Proof of Concept to proven technology, which will result in products, technical processes or solutions that are significantly different from already available products, technical processes or services. These innovations must offer added value to the economy, society or the environment.
