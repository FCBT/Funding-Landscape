The objective of the impulse programme Swiss Innovation Power is to stimulate the innovation activities, to maintain the innovative strength and secure the long-term competitiveness of small to medium-sized companies in Switzerland in view of the current Covid-19 pandemic. Within the scope of this impulse programme, the contributions of the implementation partners can be reduced in comparison to the standard innovation projects. Applicants can chose either measure 1 or measure 2 for new projects submitted in 2021 and 2022. The Federal Council decided to launch this impulse programme through Innosuisse on 11 November 2020.
