 The Gottfried and Julia Bangerter-Rhyner Foundation and the SAMS launched the Young Talents in Clinical Research (YTCR) funding program in 2017 to encourage more young medical doctors to start out in clinical research. At the end of the first funding period (2017 – 2020), the Bangerter Foundation has renewed its funding for four more years (2021 – 2024) with a total of 4 million francs to support young physicians with «protected time for research» and «project grants».

Medical doctors engaged in clinical research are faced with many challenges, including the lack of time, particularly during medical training, and the scarcity of funding for research projects. There is currently no system-inherent support in Switzerland for young doctors starting out in clinical research: they must acquire the necessary theoretical and practical skills mostly on their own. By funding protected time for research and project grants, «Young Talents in Clinical Research» contributes to improving the quality of clinical research in Switzerland and to implementing the Roadmap for developing the next generation of clinical researchers of the Federal Office of Public Health.
