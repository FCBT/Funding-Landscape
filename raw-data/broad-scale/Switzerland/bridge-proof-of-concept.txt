The “BRIDGE Proof of Concept” funding scheme fosters the further development of scientific results to
evaluate their market or societal potential. It supports researchers who wish to develop an application based
on their research results with a view to becoming entrepreneurs, or to implement their research results with
a partner from the private or the public sector.
2 The evaluation criteria include a commitment to sustainable development (including economic, societal and
environmental consequences) in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United
Nations.2
3 BRIDGE Proof of Concept projects may cover any type of innovation or research field.
