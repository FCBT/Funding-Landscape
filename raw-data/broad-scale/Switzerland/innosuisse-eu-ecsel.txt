 ECSEL: cross-border cooperation in the electronics field

The ECSEL (Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership) initiative supports market-oriented joint R&D in the nanoelectronics and embedded computer systems segment between partners in European industry (including SMEs) and universities of applied sciences.

As part of a public-private partnership between the EU Commission, European industry associations, 26 EU member states and the associate countries Israel, Norway, Turkey und Switzerland, annual calls for proposals are conducted for market-oriented, experimental research and industrial development projects.

The legal basis for this initiative is article 187 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Its host organisation is ECSEL Joint Undertaking (ECSEL JU).

The ECSEL programme is open to all EU member states and the associated countries in Horizon 2020. During the 2014â€“2020 period, projects totalling EUR 4 billion are expected to be conducted. These will be funded with EUR 1.18 billion from the Horizon 2020 budget, with almost the same amount from the participating countries along with money put up by industry players.
