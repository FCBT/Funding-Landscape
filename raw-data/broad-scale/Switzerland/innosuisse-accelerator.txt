Competitive project funding for start-ups and SMEs as a transitional measure for Horizon Europe

Switzerland is currently considered a non-associated third country in terms of the EUâ€™s Horizon Europe framework programme. Swiss SMEs and start-ups are therefore not eligible to apply for funding from the European EIC Accelerator. The Federal Council adopted a transitional measure on 4 March 2022. Innosuisse is therefore introducing the Swiss Accelerator and launching the 2022 call for projects.

Innosuisse directly supports Swiss start-ups and SMEs with the Swiss Accelerator. This competitive funding programme is aimed at individual start-ups and SMEs that are carrying out innovation projects with considerable innovation potential and the goal of quickly and efficiently commercialise innovative new products and services. This aims to accelerate the growth of highly innovative Swiss companies.
Swiss Accelerator for start-ups and SMEs

Innosuisse will communicate information on a possible next call for projects via the official channels (website, newsletter, social media).
This opportunity is aimed at:

    Individual Swiss start-ups and SMEs, not consortia;
    and in particular Start-ups and SMEs based in Switzerland with no more than 250 full-time equivalents, along with the ambition to quickly and efficiently commercialise project results and scale accordingly.
