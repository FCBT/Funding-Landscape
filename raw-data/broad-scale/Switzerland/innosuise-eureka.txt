 Eureka

Are the perfect partners for your innovation project not located in Switzerland? Eureka offers you the opportunity to get involved in cross-border innovation projects. Eureka is an initiative of 50 countries aimed at fostering cross-border cooperation projects in market-oriented research and development, which is independent of the framework programmes of the European Commission. The aim of the initiative is to strengthen the competitiveness of the member states through collaboration on innovation.
Who is the offer aimed at?

Swiss consortia of at least one Swiss research partner and a Swiss company or another private or public organisation as an “implementation partner”, together with at least one partner from a Eureka member country, can apply to Innosuisse for funding for Eureka projects. Companies can also finance their participation in Eureka projects themselves.
