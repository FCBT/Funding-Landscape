 Key Digital Technologies: Innovation projects to help speed up transition to green and digital Europe

Is your company developing key digital technology or is your research institution engaged in research and development for new applications in this European key area? The European Key Digital Technologies Joint Undertaking (KDT JU) will connect your work with European partners to accelerate the production of high-quality microelectronics and to speed up the transition to green and digital Europe. The initiative focuses on large collaborative consortia contributing substantially to the design and production capabilities in Europe for strategic application areas.

Due to ongoing negotiations with the European Commission for the association of Switzerland to Horizon Europe, Switzerland is at present not a full member of the KDT JU. As a transitional measure, Innosuisse and SERI will fund Swiss partners of approved KDT projects directly.
This programme is aimed at:

    SMEs, large companies and research institutions.
