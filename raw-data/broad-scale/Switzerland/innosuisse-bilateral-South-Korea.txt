 Bilateral projects with South Korea

Innosuisse cooperates with the South Korean innovation agency to carry out joint innovation projects since 2013. Innosuisse and Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) plan to intensify their cooperation and will sign a renewed open-ended cooperation agreement in 2022.

The objective of this agreement is to encourage collaboration between Swiss and South Korean companies and research organisations to promote the exchange of knowledge and expertise, to establish sustainable partnerships and to increase business development opportunities.
Support for Swiss-Korean projects

The agreement allows Innosuisse and KIAT to intensify the existing bilateral cooperation in the fields of technology and innovation, as well as promote bottom-up collaboration opportunities in the framework of Eureka. Swiss-Korean partnerships for research and development (R&D) projects conducted by companies and research organisations are created within the framework of respective national programmes and support instruments as well as Enterprise Europe Network (EEN).
Promoting innovation

The main objective of these partnerships is to raise the level of technological competence and innovation capabilities of companies and research organisations in both countries. This allows companies to increase their competitive advantage through the development of new products, improved technical processes or solutions.

It is the responsibility of Innosuisse and KIAT to seek to support projects ranging from experimental Proof of Concept to proven technology, which will result in products, technical processes or solutions that are significantly different from already available products, technical processes or services. These innovations must offer added value to the economy, society, or the environment.
