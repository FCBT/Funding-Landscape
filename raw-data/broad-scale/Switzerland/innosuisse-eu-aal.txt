 AAL: a better quality of life for seniors

Demographics are leading to an increasing need for products and services specially geared towards older people. As part of the AAL European funding programme, innovative marketable solutions are being developed with the help of new technologies. These solutions enable the elderly to maintain the standard of living and independence that they are used to in their own home and for as long as possible.

The AAL programme is being conducted in cooperation with the EU under article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The AAL member countries provide national funding for project financing and the European Commission contributes additional money from Horizon 2020. The planned total volume of funding for the 2014-2020 period amounts to roughly EUR 600 million.

An important feature of AAL projects is their proximity to the market: two to three years after each project ends, a finished product or service should already be available.
