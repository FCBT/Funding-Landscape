 Health services research is becoming increasingly important at the international level. With the aid of this funding programme, the Gottfried and Julia Bangerter-Rhyner-Stiftung (Bangerter-Stiftung) and the SAMS hope that health services research will also become more widely established in Switzerland. To this end, the Bangerter-Stiftung was making available around CHF 1 million per year for the period 2012â€“2016.

After a period of five years this funding programme was completed at the end of 2016.
