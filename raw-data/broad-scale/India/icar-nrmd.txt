Natural Resource Management Division

Natural Resource Management Division of ICAR  is conducting basic and strategic researches to develop  technologies for conservation, management and sustainable utilization of the natural resources ensuring food, nutritional and environmental security in the country through 15 research institutes, 10 All India Coordinated Research Projects, 3 network projects and  2 Consortia Research Platforms namely on Water and Conservation Agriculture with a wide network of the Cooperating Centres and State Agricultural Universities. The  NRM research programmes  have been prioritized  within the perspective of different themes, viz;  Soil Inventory and Characterization, integrated Soil-Water-Nutrient Management, Watershed Management, Resource Conservation Technologies, Crop diversification, integrated weed management, integrated farming System including Agroforestry, dryland farming, arid, coastal and hill agriculture, abiotic stress management, climate resilient agriculture, conservation agriculture, waste water utilization, solid waste management and  applications of nanotechnology to enhance nutrient and water use efficiency. The Division is conducting research in farmers' participatory mode addressing issues at ground level and developing location specific, cost effective, ecofriendly, socially acceptable scientific farming practices keeping in view the farmers' resource availability, traditional indigenous technology knowhow and grassroot farm innovations. 

The outcome of NRM research has been promoted through various developmental Plan schemes  of the Government and contributing towards increase in agricultural productivity in the country.

Vision
Sustainable management of natural resources for achieving food, nutritional, environmental and livelihood security in the country.

Mission
Developing location specific, cost effective, eco-friendly conservation and management technologies for higher input use efficiency, agricultural productivity & profitability without deteriorating natural resource base.

Mandate
To plan, coordinate and monitor R & D programmes for sustainable agricultural production and resource conservation and to serve as knowledge repository in the field of natural resource management.
