Over the last 35 years, the Academyâ€™s Research Chairs and Senior Fellowships scheme has successfully supported over 200 academic appointments and enhanced internationally renowned centres of excellence.

This scheme aims to strengthen the links between industry and academia by supporting exceptional academics in UK universities to undertake use-inspired research that meets the needs of the industrial partners. 

Awardees are expected to:

    Establish or enhance a world leading engineering research group
    Deliver 'use-inspired' research that meets the needs of their industrial partners
    Disseminate the outcomes of their research for appropriate academic impact
    Become a self-sustaining research group by the end of the award (by securing substantial external grant income: RCUK, EU, industry, charities, etc.)
