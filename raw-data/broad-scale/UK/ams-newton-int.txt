The Academy of Medical Sciences is delighted to be working with the Royal Society and British Academy to offer Newton International Fellowships. This exciting opportunity is supported by UK Government’s Newton Fund.

We will fund, for up to two consecutive years, early career post-doctoral researchers from partner countries to carry out a research project with a host within some of the UK’s first class research environments.  The primary aims of the International Fellowships are to:

    Support the development and training of postdoctoral researchers at an early stage of their career from any country outside the UK, by providing an opportunity to work at a UK research institution for two years.
    Ensure the best postdoctoral researchers across all relevant disciplines from around the world are supported in the UK.
    Foster long-term relations between Newton International Fellows and the UK research base.
