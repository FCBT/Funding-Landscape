Many of the major challenges facing humanity today, and in the future, will cross borders and disciplinary boundaries. Addressing these challenges will require cutting edge research and innovation by people with the right global networks and interdisciplinary mindsets, especially if the challenges are to be tackled in a sustainable way that leaves no communities behind. 

The Frontiers programmes aim to address this need by building a pipeline of researchers, practitioners and innovators who are working to tackle global development challenges.

They are four strands to the programme:

    Frontiers interdisciplinary symposia
    Seed funding awarded to collaborations from symposia
    Follow on funding to scale up seed funding projects
    Becoming a Frontiers Champion with a networking grant
