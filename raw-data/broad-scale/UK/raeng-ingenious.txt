About Ingenious

Ingenious is an awards scheme for projects that engage the public with engineers and engineering while providing engineers with skills and opportunities in public engagement.

We prioritise projects that reach diverse and underrepresented audiences including communities in the most deprived neighbourhoods in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and that engage with engineers and people of different genders, ages and ethnic backgrounds.

Funding from £3,000 to £30,000 is available
Programme aims

The Ingenious awards programme aims to:

    inspire creative public engagement with engineering projects
    motivate engineers to share their stories, passion and expertise with wider audiences and develop their communication and engagement skills
    raise awareness of the diversity, nature and impact of engineering among people of all ages and backgrounds
    provide opportunities for engineers to engage with members of the public from groups currently underrepresented in engineering

We welcome proposals from engineers, universities, science and engineering communicators and engagement professionals, colleges and schools.

The Academy’s overarching goal for 2025 is to harness the power of engineering to build a sustainable society and an inclusive economy that works for everyone. We welcome projects that help us to achieve this.
