HEP SSA aims to ensure that the higher education system in sub-Saharan Africa produces engineers with the skills and knowledge required to meet the needs of industry, tackle local challenges, and address the engineering skills shortage in sub-Saharan Africa.

Grants are awarded to universities in sub-Saharan Africa for projects ranging from six months to two years. The purpose of the funding is to strengthen relationships between academia and industry. To maximise the impact of this collaboration, universities are funded to undertake bilateral secondments with local industry partners, and in turn, share their experiences with a larger number of spoke universities through a series of knowledge sharing workshops, secondments, reports and other collaborative activities.
