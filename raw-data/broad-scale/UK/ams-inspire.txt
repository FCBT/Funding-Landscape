The INSPIRE scheme aims to:

    Inspire medical, dental and veterinary undergraduates to consider a research career.
    Stimulate medical schools to design and implement local, innovative approaches to building student interest in research.
    Encourage student involvement: the experiences and needs of local students should inform the development of the local INSPIRE programme.
    Promote high quality, collaborative partnerships between members of faculty and students, and between schools and other local/regional/national organisations.
    Strengthen local, regional and national student research networks, sharing experiences and resources.
    Foster a research culture in all clinicians entering the NHS, not just those with an interest in pursuing a career in academic medicine. Likewise, INSPIRE aims to foster a research culture in dentists and vets across the country.
