The Government Office for Science offers UK Intelligence Community (IC) Postdoctoral Research Fellowships to outstanding early career science or engineering researchers. These Fellowships are designed to promote unclassified basic research in areas of interest to the intelligence, security and defence communities. The Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure, Department for Transport, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Home Office, the National Cyber Security Centre, and UK National Authority for Counter-Eavesdropping are among the organisations represented in the UK Intelligence Community for the Postdoctoral Research Fellowships.

One round of applications is held annually. Members of the IC identify research topics and the Research Fellows work locally with University Research Advisors to develop and submit research proposals that align with the topics.

The research is conducted by the Research Fellows while working in partnership with the University Research Advisor, and collaborating with an advisor from the Intelligence Community (IC Advisor). The Fellowships are aimed at early-career researchers from all branches of science and engineering who have up to five years postdoctoral experience. Each application for the Fellowships is capped at a maximum grant of £200,000 over a two-year period.
