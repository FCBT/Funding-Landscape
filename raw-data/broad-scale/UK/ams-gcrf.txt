The Global Challenges Research Fund is a five year Â£1.5 billion fund supporting cutting-edge interdisciplinary research. It aims to address global issues through challenge-led research and strengthen research capacity both in the UK and in developing countries. Our GCRF networking grants:

    Provide opportunities for researchers from a wide spectrum of disciplines and backgrounds to develop new collaborations.
    Improve interaction between UK researchers and those in developing countries.
    Build communities of researchers that can submit high quality applications for other GCRF funding calls.
