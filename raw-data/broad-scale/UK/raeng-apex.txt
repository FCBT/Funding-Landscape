In partnership with the British Academy, the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering (‘the Academies’) and with generous support from the Leverhulme Trust, the APEX award (Academies Partnership in Supporting Excellence in Cross-disciplinary research award) scheme offers established independent researchers, with a strong track record in their respective area, an exciting opportunity to pursue genuine interdisciplinary and curiosity-driven research to benefit wider society.

The objectives of this scheme are to:

    Promote collaboration across disciplines, with a particular emphasis on the boundary between science, engineering and the social sciences and humanities
    Support outstanding interdisciplinary research which is unlikely to be supported through conventional funding programmes
    Support researchers with an outstanding track record, in developing their research in a new direction through collaboration with partners from other disciplines
    Enable outstanding researchers to focus on advancing their innovative research through seed funding
