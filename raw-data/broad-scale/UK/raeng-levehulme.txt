As academics progress through their careers from postdoctoral positions into more senior roles, their workload evolves to include more teaching and administrative responsibilities. As a result, they are left with less time to dedicate to research.

The RAEng/Leverhulme Trust Research Fellowships aim to address this by allowing the academics to concentrate on full-time research and be relieved of teaching and administrative responsibilities. The purpose of the Fellowships is to cover the salary costs of a replacement academic who will take over the awardee’s teaching and administration duties for up to one year.

The fellowships are funded by the kind support of The Leverhulme Trust.
The Leverhulme Trust

The Leverhulme Trust was established by the Will of William Hesketh Lever, the founder of Lever Brothers. Since 1925, the Trust has supported grants and scholarships for research and education. Today, The Leverhulme Trust is one of the largest all-subject providers of research funding in the UK, distributing over £60m a year. The Trust provides funding across a range of academic disciplines such as arts, sciences, engineering and social sciences, with an aim of supporting talented individuals to realise their personal vision in research and professional training.
Key benefits of the fellowship:

    These fellowships provide engineering academics with an opportunity to reinvigorate their research careers, enhance their current research interests or start new lines of research without teaching or administrative constraints
    They also provide an opportunity for the junior academic to gain valuable teaching and administrative experience by covering the duties of the awardee
    An additional support fund of up to £2,500 is available to the awardee for miscellaneous research costs
