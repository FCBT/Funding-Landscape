The Royal Academy of Engineering offers Research Fellowships each year to outstanding early-career researchers to support them to become future research leaders in engineering. The scheme's objectives are to:

    support the best early-career researchers in establishing their independence and international reputation
    provide long-term support enabling the pursuit of an ambitious programme of engineering research and impact
    develop ambassadors for the Academy and advocates for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines
