The scheme was established by the Academy in partnership with Lord and Lady Turnberg in memory of their late son Daniel Turnberg, a doctor and researcher with a keen interest in fostering links between the UK and the Middle East.

The Daniel Turnberg Travel Fellowships encourage researchers to experience an alternative research environment, learn new techniques and develop ideas for future collaborations. They are aimed primarily at early- and mid-career scientists, particularly those just embarking on a career in research. Since its launch in 2008, the scheme has awarded nearly 300 Travel Fellowships to researchers from all countries eligible to apply.
