The Academy of Medical Sciences is delighted to be working with the Royal Society and British Academy to offer Newton Advanced Fellowships. This exciting opportunity is supported by UK Governmentâ€™s Newton Fund.

We will fund, for up to three years, early career group and network leaders in partner countries to develop their research by linking them with some of the best research groups in the UK. The primary aims of the Advanced Fellowships are to:

    Support the development of a well-trained research community who can contribute to advancing economic development and social welfare of the partner country, by transferring new skills and creating new knowledge.
    Strengthen research excellence in the partner country by supporting promising independent early to mid-career researchers and their research groups and networks.
    Establish long term collaborative links between the next generation of research leaders, and their groups and networks in the partner country, and the UK, to benefit both research communities
