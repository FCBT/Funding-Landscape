The Academy of Medical Sciences embraces the broad diversity of biomedical and clinical research. While advances in basic and applied medical research are leading to a better understanding of the ways to prevent, treat and cure disease, they do not necessarily address the major social, behavioural, political and cultural issues that contribute to health inequalities. The Academy’s ‘Health of the Public in 2040’ initiative aims to identify the main health challenges the UK population will face by 2040 and recognises that, in order to solve many of these issues, a multidisciplinary approach will be required.

With support from the Wellcome Trust, the Academy is pleased to offer funding for newly independent researchers in health social sciences and medical humanities working on projects related to the environments and themes that have emerged from our ‘Improving the health of the public by 2040’ report.
