    regenerative medicine and stem cells.

Our data science vision and strategy

MRC’s vision is to gain new scientific insights into health and wellbeing by harnessing relevant information from clinical, population, cellular and molecular datasets, and a wide variety of other sources.

This vision is underpinned by five strategic elements:

    supporting cutting-edge research using large datasets
    funding infrastructure, tools and technologies to enable data collection, management, storage, linkage, analysis and interpretation
    building capacity in the range of data science skills needed for such data-driven research and innovation
    policies to encourage FAIR data – which meets the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability
    developing frameworks and guidance to protect sensitive data and ensure data is managed in safe research environments with appropriate governance.
