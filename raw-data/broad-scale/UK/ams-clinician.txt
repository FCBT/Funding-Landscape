The Health Foundation is working with the Academy of Medical Sciences to deliver the Clinician Scientist Fellowship programme. The programme focuses on ‘translational research’ – that is, research that has a direct benefit to patients. The findings can then be used to shape healthcare, by influencing policy or informing professional practice.

    Reporting 

Clinician Scientist Fellowships were developed by many funders as a result of the Academy's report, 'The Tenured Track Clinician Scientist: a new career pathway to promote recruitment into academic medicine' in March 2000. In 2001 we launched our own Clinician Scientist Fellowship and, in partnership with the Health Foundation, we have supported a growing cohort of clinical academics to pursue and develop their research within a clinical setting.

Over four rounds of funding, we have supported 26 outstanding clinicians who are committed to improving practice through advances in clinical research, and are driven to inspire others. Our Clinician Scientist Fellows have the opportunity to build the foundations for a career in clinical academic medicine while conducting valuable research that will improve the quality of care for patients.

In 2012, we commissioned an independent evaluation of cohorts 1-3 in this scheme. You can download the evaluation report from the right hand side of this page.
