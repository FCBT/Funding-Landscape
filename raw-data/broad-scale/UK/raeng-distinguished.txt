The Distinguished International Associates Programme is a programme for excellent international engineers working across all sectors, who are at the cutting edge of engineering research or innovation, and have existing collaborations or connections to the UK which they would like to intensify.
 

The programme aims to develop a broad international community or network of excellent diverse engineers across countries and disciplines, with research and innovation links to the UK, to work alongside the Academy to enhance progress towards achieving its goals for an inclusive economy and sustainable society.
Programme objectives

The programme’s objectives are to:

    Support and strengthen existing collaborations and engagement between awardees and their peers in the UK engineering community
    Empower Associates who can further broaden and demonstrate meaningful links with the UK and the Academy to promote their activities where they align with the Academy’s objectives 
    Build a peer support network of “International Associates” to facilitate international cooperation and to stimulate the engineering communities in participants’ home countries
    Facilitate opportunities for alumni to create and strengthen their own research, innovation, or policy links to the UK engineering community

Awardees will be offered a grant to amplify the impact of their collaboration with the UK in an area which aligns with the Academy’s strategic priority themes. The award would enable awardees to develop or strengthen their research, innovation, and policy links to the UK and to improve and deepen links between the UK and their country of residence, through visits, workshops, communication and public engagement activities. 
Funding
Successful awardees will receive funding of up to £10,000 for up to 24 months. The award would be accompanied with participation in an international network of Distinguished International Associates, supported by the Academy, through annual events as well as online engagement opportunities.
