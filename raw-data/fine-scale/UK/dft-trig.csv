2014,Absorbtion of nitrogen oxides at the roadside using mushrooms ,"this project aims to explore the feasibility of using spent mushroom hyphae to reduce NOx pollution in the UK. The project will investigate a number of mushroom species similar to those tested in Hong Kong and test their potential to absorb NOx in a controlled laboratory environment. A small scale field-based test will be conducted to determine their efficacy in the UK climate. If this is successful, we would recommend further work to install mushroom barriers alongside a strategic road network.",TRL,Large ,T-TRIG
2014,NOx Mitigation by absorption in solid mineral polymer matrix,"The proposal, then, is to produce and test a range of polymers, designed to pick up NOx molecules and then desorb them under certain stimuli.

The quantifiable absorption properties would then be available to assess the feasibility for their use to prove the concept as a cost effective and safe solution to the issues of roadside NOx concentrations.

2014,Dynamic Control and optimisation of high NOx regions by the creation of a real time dynamic NOx Map and the active management of Range Extended Electric Vehicles ,This proposal is to investigate the feasibility of creating a publicly available real time NOx map and impact (by vehicle) of managing NOX production when a REEV?s range extender is dynamically controlled remotely.  This control is based upon route and real time NOX data measured at the road side and centrally collated,Teva Motors Ltd,SME,T-TRIG
