In this project, we will find a key mechanism by which zebrafish make new heart muscle cells, the essential building blocks of the heart, and test whether we can also increase new muscle in mouse hearts using the finding from zebrafish. Results from this study may help to understand how heart function can be recovered in patients who had a heart attack."
