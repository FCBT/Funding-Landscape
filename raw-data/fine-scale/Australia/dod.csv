NS210100106,National Intelligence and Security Discovery Research Grants,2021,NS  ,Defence Science and Technology,2020,1,NS21 Round 1,The University of New South Wales,Department of Defence,Enhanced Disinformation Detection,"Disinformation is a significant and growing problem that can be used to undermine the nation’s security. This project aims to apply a novel interdisciplinary approach to learn more about how disinformation can be systematically identified, and how to categorise the clusters of disinformation that are more likely to be believed and spread. The project expects to build upon evidence-based knowledge on how to detect and counter disinformation in Australia. Expected outcomes of the project include an annotated dataset that could be used to improve detection tools and future research, a white paper delineating suggested policy and academic publications. Benefits include move forward to protect the nation’s security and citizens’ quality of life.",Prof Monica Whitty,520502.0,Active,1608 - Sociology,2024-12-29,Prof Monica Whitty; A/Prof Stephen Doherty; Prof Richard Sinnott,"[{'priority-type': 'The National Security Challenges', 'priority-name': 'Disinformation Detection and Counter Narratives'}]",https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/RGS/API/grants/NS210100106,2021-12-30,1608 - Sociology; 160808 - Sociology and Social Studies of Science and Technology,810104 - Emerging Defence Technologies; 810107 - National Security

A compact and low-power sensor would provide a step change in the methods and protocols used for their detection. Expected outcomes include detection design rules and materials for the sensitive, selective and rapid trace sensing of contraband narcotics. The best performing materials will be incorporated into a prototype handheld detector suitable for evaluation in the field and demonstration to potential end users. The information provided by trace detection and its rapid nature will lead to enhanced safety for border security, law enforcement, defence, and healthcare personnel, and the wider community.",Prof Paul Burn,599186.0,Active,0912 - Materials Engineering,2024-12-28,Prof Paul Burn; Dr Paul Shaw; Prof Ian Gentle,"[{'priority-type': 'The National Security Challenges', 'priority-name': 'Detection for 2040'}]",https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/RGS/API/grants/NS210100131,2021-12-29,030303 - Optical Properties of Materials; 0912 - Materials Engineering; 091205 - Functional Materials,810107 - National Security; 970102 - Expanding Knowledge In the Physical Sciences; 970103 - Expanding Knowledge In the Chemical Sciences
