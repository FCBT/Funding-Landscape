This project will determine how immune cells recognise the antibody-coated viruses ‘hiding’ within them, and the defence response they launch to eliminate viral infection. Such knowledge may allow us to develop better anti-viral drugs and vaccines to fight viral diseases like the common cold."

It will also explore whether some men who do not receive active treatment (healthy older men) would benefit if they did."

I aim to find out how current therapies cause secondary cancers; with the hope of finding alternative therapies for multiple myeloma that do not cause secondary cancers."

This research will provide insight into these processes, and in doing so will further our understanding of how B cell cancers develop and how they are destroyed."

Strategies to increase the uptake of treatments are urgently required. My translational research project will develop and validate a pathway of care for the treatment of alcohol use disorders in general practice."
