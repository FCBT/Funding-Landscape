Their value for money, however, is questionable without solid health economic evidence. In addition, patient preference for OP treatment is not well understood. My project is to develop a global health economics model to identify cost-effective treatments, and to elicit patient preference for different OP treatments."

Although drugs that block the aldosterone receptor are beneficial in the treatment of heart failure, they are limited by potassium retention in the kidney. In order to develop tissue-specific blockers of the aldosterone receptor, it is necessary to identify mechanisms by which the receptor can be activated and/or blocked in these tissues."

We propose that identifying how these proteins act to control interferon will aid in developing new treatments for lupus."
