Early-onset severe epilepsies are devastating childhood-onset disorders associated with significant disabilities. They are often caused by ‘mutations’ in genes responsible for ion-channels. Treatment options are extremely limited, because mechanisms are poorly understood. Human induced-pluripotent stem-cells(iPSCs) offer a novel opportunity to create “minibrain” models of epilepsy in a dish. We will recruit patients with severe genetic epilepsy and generate iPSCs from skin fibroblasts, differentiate 3D-organoids into cortical neurons. Ion-channel dysfunction can be investigated utilising state-of-the-art multiple electrode array(MEA), which may identify novel biomarkers, and facilitate micro-RNA experiments, and drug-screening in human neurons.",
